      <p className="mb-6 text-sm">
        Green politics is a new and radical kind of politics guided by ten core principles. These
        values shape all our policies and actions.
      </p>

      <ol className="list-decimal space-y-4 pl-6 text-sm">
        <li>
          The Green Party supports a radical transformation of society for the benefit of all and
          for the planet as a whole. We understand that the threats to economic, social and
          environmental wellbeing are interconnected.
        </li>
        <li>
          The success of a society cannot be measured by narrow economic indicators, but should also
          account for personal freedom, equity, health, happiness, human fulfilment and ecological
          wellbeing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Humankind depends on the diversity of the natural world for its existence. Other species
          are not expendable.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Earth's physical resources are finite. We must build a sustainable society that
          guarantees long-term future wellbeing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Every person, in this and future generations, should be entitled to basic material
          security as of right.
        </li>
        <li>
          Our actions must consider the wellbeing of other nations, other species, and future
          generations.
        </li>
        <li>
          A healthy society is based on voluntary cooperation in a democratic society, free from
          discrimination of all kinds.
        </li>
        <li>
          We emphasise democratic participation and accountability, ensuring decisions are made at
          the closest practical level to those affected.
        </li>
        <li>
          We seek non-violent solutions to conflict that take into account the interests of
          minorities and future generations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Electoral politics is not the only way to achieve change. We support lifestyle change and
          non-violent direct action where it aligns with our principles.
