# Climate Emergency

[bs-toc depth="5"]

CC001
The climate emergency is the greatest issue of our time. It is a global crisis demanding a global response. The UK should play a leading role by strengthening international agreements and rapidly reducing its own emissions.

The Global Crisis

CC011
We face a climate emergency. Earth's climate is already changing at unprecedented speed, exemplified by higher temperatures, rising sea levels, ocean acidification and more frequent and severe floods, droughts, and storms. The consequences of the climate emergency already include wars, starvation, disease, desertification and forced migration; not to mention species extinction. The UK itself has seen increased flooding. 

CC012
The climate emergency is caused by the release of greenhouse gases, and is already set to get worse. Unless it is checked, there is a real danger that positive feedback will lead to rapid, runaway effects.

CC013
The Climate Emergency is a global problem. We continue to support the aims of the Paris Agreement to hold “the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above preindustrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels”. However, we recognise the failure of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process to deliver the required rapid reductions in emissions to achieve those aims. GPEW would therefore seek to work with willing partners to ensure the UK takes a lead in demonstrating the technical and societal changes required to face this existential threat.

CC014
As a rich country that was the first to industrialise and a major emitter of greenhouse gases over many decades the UK bears a particular responsibility. It should: 

Recognise that, regardless of international targets being missed, every fraction of a degree temperature increase matters, and legislate accordingly. 

Work sector by sector to deliver against its Paris Agreement commitments through ambitious policies on emissions reductions, climate finance, capacity building and technology transfer that focus on the need to act immediately.

Pay compensation for climate-related loss and damage, making this a key element of delivering international action and equity.

Advocate an emergency international agreement to conserve and enhance carbon sinks and reservoirs including forests, peatfields and coastal and estuarine areas, and demonstrate real action within the UK.

Reduce, the emissions associated with its imports by restricting the import of high carbon goods.

Support the Sustainable Development Goals with the exception of Goal 8 that we do not support in its entirety due to its emphasis on economic growth (see
Philosophical Basis: PB106
). 

CC015
The UK should base its future emissions budgets on the principles of science and equity with the aim of keeping global warming below 1.5 C. Minimising climate harm therefore requires the UK limiting its total cumulative emissions, both territorial and consumption, as far as possible. It is acknowledged that this would require eliminating all carbon dioxide emissions before 2030, which is unlikely to be possible. Not achieving this, and similar failure by other countries, is locking the world into dangerous global warming above 1.5 C. All further emissions increase the likelihood and severity of climate harm. The urgency requires the UK to make overcoming the technological, political and social obstacles a national priority. 

CC016
The UK should target eliminating all carbon dioxide emissions within 10 years on a consumption basis. The Green Party of England and Wales will continue to develop a policy package that will reduce the UK’s production and consumption greenhouse gas emissions as quickly as possible. Updates on targets and forecasts will be recorded in Record of Policy Statements, Green Party manifestos and reports to conference. 

CC017
A zero carbon society in the UK should be achieved through action in the UK and not through international carbon trading or offsets.

CC018
In addition to its mitigation efforts, the UK should create an adaptation programme which ensures the safety of its citizens, as well as of key property and infrastructure. 

UK Domestic Emissions 

CC100
To reduce its domestic emissions the UK requires a centrally-led transformation programme which will involve substantial state funding and require changes in the behaviour of ordinary citizens. To gain public consent for the necessary changes the government should conduct a major public education campaign.

CC101
The transformation needed for the Climate Emergency mitigation will provide significant benefits. In the short-term the work needed will provide economic stimulus and satisfying and secure work for many workers. In the longer term there will be substantial improvements in health and wellbeing.

Governance 

CC110
For clear accountability the UK should: 

Learning from the Welsh experience of its Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act, introduce a pan UK version to work with the four nations of the UK to enshrine in law in all four governments the need to make decisions for the long-term benefit of humanity.

Strengthen the Climate Change Act to require the Climate Change Committee to set budgets on the basis of the latest climate science and global equity, and the principles included in (CC014).

Require all Government policies to take account of the Wellbeing of Future Generations Act and to ensure impacts on the environment, society and intergenerational equity are considered.

Require all public bodies, industrial sectors and businesses to define their own adaptation plans and Locally- Determined Contributions (LDCs) to climate change mitigation, with sectoral limits set by the Climate Change Committee.

Demand reduction

CC120
To reduce the demand for high-carbon products and services, especially space heating, travel and meat consumption, UK policy should encourage small families, a circular economy, less avoidable consumption and a shift to low carbon products, services and processes.

CC121
To drive change throughout society the UK should combine a carbon tax and dividend with publicity campaigns and possible carbon rationing. The adverting of high carbon and other environmentally damaging products will also be regulated to reduce demand, and ensure consumers have a more accurate picture of such goods, products and services. This will be achieved via measures such as a ban on the advertising of high carbon products, alongside environmental health warnings and the promotion of zero carbon alternatives. The carbon tax would reflect most emissions of all greenhouse gases (not just CO2). See
Economy: EC777
for exceptions to the carbon tax. It should have a progressive element to deter high individual emitters. 

Energy efficiency 

CC130
To improve energy efficiency the UK should: 

Invest heavily in energy efficiency in all sectors, especially in housing (including funding for retrofitting), industry and transport. 

Set energy efficiency standards for vehicles, appliances and equipment at the best currently available and tighten them progressively thereafter.

Decarbonise the energy system 

CC140
To decarbonise the energy system the UK should: 

Switch its sources of energy system from fossil fuels to renewables by changing incentives and by direct investment.

Greatly increase the use of electricity, expand the grid and develop heat networks.

To provide resilience it should implement interconnectors with overseas electricity systems, a smart grid and a variety of energy storage systems.

Finance 

CC150
To encourage long-term ecological thinking in the finance sector the UK should: 

Require full disclosure of the climate-related risks on all investments. 

Require all managers of pension and investment funds based in the UK to divest themselves of holdings in fossil fuel companies, most urgently from coal. 

Capturing greenhouse gases 

CC160
The UK should develop, and expect to deploy, systems to remove CO2 and other greenhouse gases from the air and from the exhaust from industrial processes such as cement making. This will require investment in Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) systems which may also need to be used with some power plants. 

R&D and pilots 

CC170
The UK should fund R&D and pilot projects in key emerging technologies such as NETs, Solar Radiation Management and artificial meat. 

The long-term 

CC200
In the long-term the UK should seek to reduce the need for people and goods to travel by a new approach to planning that will place work, living, retail and leisure facilities close together.
