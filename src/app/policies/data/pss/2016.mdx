Record of Policy Statements (RoPS)

Frequent Flier Levy

The Green Party would replace the Air Passenger Duty (APD) with a Frequent Flyer Levy (FFL), which would vary depending on the number of previous flights taken by an individual. The Frequent Flyer Levy would be zero for an individual’s first outbound flight in each year and increase continually for each subsequent outbound flight.

Approved by GPRC 16 October 2016

Opposition to The Government’s Prevent Strategy

The Green Party calls for urgent review of the implementation of the Prevent strategy and its implications for tackling extremism as well as preserving good community relations. We would pursue community-led collaborative approaches to tackling all forms of extremism and not allow the disproportionate targeting of the Muslim community as evidenced by Prevent in its current form.

Passed Autumn 2016

Opposition to the Conservatives’ Trade Union Act

The Green Party supports the right of working people to form and join free, democratic and self-governing trade unions, without restriction by employer or government. Our policies call for a legal framework which will enable workers to pursue legitimate trade disputes, with appropriate rights and protections in the law.

However, the Conservatives’ Trade Union Act seeks to hamper the ability of Trade Unions to improve the pay and conditions of workers, at a time when wages are already suppressed and inequality rising. It raises additional legal barriers to the right to strike, on top of what was already the most complicated legislation on industrial action in the democratic world. It also attempts to impose a range of needless new financial and legal burdens on Trade Unions.

The Green Party congratulates Caroline Lucas on her efforts to oppose this Bill during its passage through Parliament, and in particular her call for direct action to resist it following its passage into law.

The Green Party calls on the UK Government to repeal the Trade Union Act, and calls on Green Party members and supporters to lend their support to their Trade Unions as they take action to defy it.

Passed Autumn 2016

Foreign policy and bombing of Yemen by Saudi Arabia

The Saudi bombing campaign, and the food, water and medicines blockade against  Yemen has intensified catastrophically.  The Green Party is very concerned about the effects of the war conducted by one of the world’s richest countries, Saudi Arabia, on one of the poorest, Yemen. We demand:

That Britain end the current supply of UN-banned cluster munitions to Saudi Arabia which are being used to bomb schools, hospitals and orphanages in Yemen.

That Britain end all military assistance to the Saudi Arabia bombing campaign against civilians in Yemen and end all Royal Naval support for the Saudi water, food and medicines blockade of Yemen.
