Context

LD001
We live on land. We play, work, farm and build on land. However, we share the land with the nature on which our survival depends. Our policy for land-use must balance humanity’s wish to control the earth for human benefit, with the need to share and not destroy what we rely on. Humanity cannot completely control the earth, and neither should it try to, as we are reliant on its full complexity. Our society should strive for a stable environment, in part by taking a stewardship approach to land management. This requires accepting responsibilities, such as to future generations and to other life, when taking land management decisions. (see

and

).

LD002
Land is finite, the primary source of all real wealth, and a common heritage. The way land is managed needs to deliver good soil health, good human health, and a resilient society, as well as maintain a stable climate and diverse ecosystems. This currently is not happening because our economy has a dysfunctional relationship with the land. A small number of people control most of the land, mostly for historical reasons, but also due to wealth inequality. This is unjust. In UK law today the Crown and Duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster are the default owners of land if no one else holds the land title.

LD100
Land principles:

The overrunning of the planet’s natural limits and the unsustainable use of its resources should be considered as one challenge (see the Philosophical Basis)

Human activity must be managed within Earth’s natural limits

Land is held in trust and managed by human society for its own needs and the needs of other species and future generations; its use should enhance the richness of life

Land management is crucial in securing the protection, regeneration, and restoration of nature

Land management should maximise multiple benefits of land

The rights and responsibilities of those who hold land will be transparent and accountable

People may have rights over the use of land but this should not give unconditional ownership or control of it

Land should be managed for the “common good” of communities and therefore relevant communities should have a role in determining its use

Land use change should be largely implemented at the landscape scale, at which natural systems tend to work best

Benefits that come from holding land title should be distributed according to need (mainly via taxation)

Treating land as a store of wealth should be discouraged, as should trading it for speculative profit

LD200
Outcomes
Our policies aim to deliver the following which together define the “common good” within this context:

Improved transparency of information about the ownership of land

Increasing equality of access to land for recreation, health, education, to grow food and reduce wealth inequality

A transition in land-use that will be nearing completion in 10 years

Increased biodiversity and abundance across all land

Balancing of the natural cycles, including carbon and nitrogen, to deliver a stable biosphere

Reducing emissions from land

Increasing carbon sinks and carbon uptake

‘Wildlife and Habitats’ policy outcomes (
Wildlife and Habitats: WH003
) and ‘Food and Agriculture’ policy aims (
Food and Agriculture: FA101
)

Healthy and nutritious food and other resources for local need

Resilient communities and sustainable livelihoods

Policies

LD300 Land Ownership and Stewardship

LD301
All land in the UK may only be held by individuals, companies or other organisations that pay full tax on their UK earnings (see
Economy: EC796
and
Economy: EC797
). The Land Registry will define and provide the record of who holds the land title and is responsible for stewarding it, which in law would be permanent tenure. There will be compulsory registration of all land (see
Local Planning and the Built Environment: LP517
) within a statutory time limit, which will include name and address of the ultimate beneficial owners of the land.

LD302
The holder of a land title (steward), will have responsibilities for stewarding land for the “common good” (
Philosophical Basis: PB451
,
Migration: MG201
) which will be reasonable and clear - taking into account traditional practice and communities, and the land must be managed with the primary objective of achieving positive outcomes for biodiversity. Advice and financial help will be available (see
Land: LD502
and
Food and Agriculture: FA204
and
Food and Agriculture: FA300
). Stewardship will be transferred with ownership and they cannot be separated. This will primarily affect large pieces of land rather than private gardens.

LD303
Land unregistered for any reason (for example where an owner cannot be established, which ceases to have an owner, or for which ownership is removed (see
Land: LD304
) will by default fall to new organisations called Commons Trusts rather than the Crown or Duchies, as now (See
Land: LD002
). Commons Trusts will be independent of Government and will be funded by revenues, such as Land Value Taxation (see
Economy: EC780
). The Commons Trusts’ policies, and major decisions will be made in accordance with the principles of democratic participation (see
Public Administration and Government: PA102
and
Public Administration and Government: PA103
).

LD304
The Commons Trusts would be empowered to:

Provide advice and guidance on land stewardship;

Facilitate mediation on land stewardship conflicts in communities;

Facilitate voluntary reparations for the restoration of land;

Issue warnings regarding failures of land stewardship;

As a last resort, enforce stewardship requirements by preparing a prosecution case for referral to the legal system.

Where land is held by companies or other organisations, directors or board members will be held personally responsible for failures of land stewardship. Restorative justice is preferred, with the minimal intervention required to deliver that justice (see
Responsibilities and Rights: RR1002-1003
,
Crime and Justice: CJ200-206
&
Crime and Justice: CJ362
).

The maximum penalty for breach of stewardship would be removal of the land, by compulsory purchase by the Commons Trust (as the first charge prior to all other liabilities, including the banks/ and other lenders), with the deduction of reparations and costs.

Where land is held by limited companies, directors may be held personally responsible.

LD400 Land Use Transition

LD401
Changing land use is fundamental to delivering a sustainable society. Management of land should deliver multiple benefits. Policy levers (
Land: LD502
) will deliver the benefits at national scale, so that the following priority order is taken into account within the broad context:

Reversing biodiversity loss and increasing abundance

Reducing carbon emissions from land (e.g. peatland restoration),

Being self-sufficient in food production and biological sequestration (e.g. growing forests),

Managing land for timber and fibre

Growing biomass (wood and crops) for energy production

Change must start now and should be nearing completion in 10 years time. This will be achieved by encouraging and supporting people to be good stewards of the land.

LD402
Peatlands must be restored as quickly as possible to a near natural condition. Rewetting of lowland farmland on peat must take precedence over upland peat, and begin immediately. Tree planting on peatland is unviable and must stop (and all existing forestry removed). This will be achieved primarily through land management investment and support. (See also
Climate Emergency: CC014
,
Food and Agriculture: FA206
,
Food and Agriculture: FA301
,
Wildlife and Habitats: WH101-102
).

LD403
The land for the production of raw materials, such as wood, hemp and flax, will be significantly increased, to displace non-renewable (such as concrete, steel and plastic) and imported natural resources (that are produced unsustainably). This will be achieved mainly through fiscal measures (see
Land: LD502
), but may need to be backed up by additional policy to encourage behavioural change through public education, price signals, taxation and regulation, and technological development.

LD404
Scotland has a Land Commission, and we will introduce Land Commission(s) in the rest of the nation that will provide policy and best practice advice on the rights and responsibility of ownership. This will apply at all scales of use – from gardens to estates; from neighbourhood to catchment or bioregion.

LD405
The Land Commission(s) will review the implications of the current distribution of land holdings, and bring forward policies towards a more equitable distribution of ownership.

LD406
Government will have a power to designate land for nationally significant infrastructure.

LD407
Government will also have the power to designate land critical for certain purposes, for example National Parks and ancient woodland; and also may make new land use designations such as peatland, wetland, saltmarsh. See also
Wildlife and Habitats: WH104

LD500 Delivering land use change.

LD501
Land use strategies and plans will enable the land use transition. These strategies and plans will guide the use of the policy levers (
Land: LD502
), to ensure delivery of the outcomes (
Land: LD200
).

Major changes will be needed to the current planning system, which will include a mechanism for delivering the key outcomes of this policy, bottom-up and top-down. Power will be held and decisions made, democratically and at the most appropriate local level (
Philosophical Basis: PB302
).
Industry: IN402
contains a duty to cooperate at national level and this will apply.

LD502
Policy levers to deliver the proposed changes include:

Capacity building and delivering a just transition

The planning system

Land management investment and support

Fiscal measures (taxes, tax breaks and grants)

Direct government ownership and

Enforcement of stewardship responsibilities by the Commons Trust

LD503
To build capacity and deliver a just transition we will need to facilitate a mindset change to a new way of using land. We will need education, training, and support services. It is also critical that there is support for people whose livelihoods will need to change (
Industry: IN205
,
Marine and Coastal: MC363
). Measures will include:

Public information campaigns

Funding for land use research (see
Forestry: FR1400
,
Food and Agriculture: FA301
)

Funding and expansion of agricultural colleges and land based apprenticeships (see
Food and Agriculture: FA204
)

Start-up funding for young entrepreneurs in agriculture/horticulture (see
Food and Agriculture: FA203
)

Farm and land business advisory services (see
Food and Agriculture: FA202
,
Food and Agriculture: FA204
,
Food and Agriculture: FA301
,
Food and Agriculture: FA304
)

Support for retraining and relocating

LD504
The planning system will provide accountability and democratic control over land through compliance with local and regional plans. It will recognise that a healthy environment is the only guarantee for future generations and communities. There will need to be compliance between local and regional plans to ensure equitable use of land, which is a scarce resource.

It will provide a mechanism for levying carbon tax (
Economy: EC777
) against land use change emissions associated with construction. There will need to be land use designations for permanent pasture, forestry, peatland, land under agricultural rotation and degraded land. See also
Food and Agriculture: FA301
,
Local Planning and the Built Environment: LP412
,
Local Planning and the Built Environment: LP505
,
Local Planning and the Built Environment: LP514
and
Local Planning and the Built Environment: LP517
.

LD505
Land management investment and support will be delivered by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and the Forestry Commission. See also
Economy: EC781
,
Food and Agriculture: FA304
,
Food and Agriculture: FA202-204
,
Wildlife and Habitats: WH100-106
, and
Forestry: FR603
.

LD506
Fiscal measures - These measures include:

Land Value Tax - see
Economy: EC780
,
Economy: EC781
,
Economy: EC782
,
Economy: EC792

Carbon tax - see
Economy: EC777
,
Food and Agriculture: FA301
and
Climate Emergency: CC121

Tax breaks and “eco-taxes” - see
Economy: EC776

Grants (including for land use change)

LD507
Direct government ownership (local, regional and national) includes public forestry estate (
Forestry: FR200
), and social housing (
Housing: HO500-505
).

LD508
Enforcement of stewardship responsibilities - As a mechanism of last resort Commons Trusts will have enforcement powers (see
Land: LD304
).
