Record of Policy Statements (RoPS)

Oppose Stonehenge Tunnel Plan

This Conference notes that the plan by the government and Highways England to build a new dual carriageway road and 2.9km tunnel within the Stonehenge World Heritage Site has been unanimously condemned by all the leading British archaeologists and by UNESCO, because it would cause serious and irreparable damage to the World Heritage Site. We also note that the historical evidence of other road building schemes shows that they do not solve problems of traffic congestion, but rather shift that congestion from one place to another while encouraging further traffic growth overall, and that any increase in road traffic is directly contrary to the overwhelming imperative of reducing the emissions which are driving climate change. In this context, we need to conserve our future as well as our past.

We therefore strongly urge the government to abandon the present tunnel plan, and to seriously examine all other options to improve transport links in the area whilst avoiding any further damage to the Stonehenge World Heritage Site. This examination should not be limited to alternative road routes, but should include more environmentally sustainable options for infrastructure investment such as improving the capacity of the London to Exeter rail line to carry more freight in order to relieve pressure on the A303.

Reducing Plastic Waste

Conference notes that the Ellen MacArthur Foundation has calculated that the weight of plastics in the ocean is likely to exceed that of fish by 2050, and that there's been recent campaigns and some limited action on microbeads, plastic cotton bud sticks, single-use beverage cups and drink bottles and drinking straws, but that far more needs to be done.

It calls on the national executive to campaign to reduce and end the environmental damage done by unnecessary single use plastics, both these products and others, and for our elected representatives to take what action they can to this end.

Great Repeal Bill

Following the Great Repeal Bill announcement of 30 March 2017 GPEW states its belief that as the UK government has chosen its course of wholesale withdrawal from so many EU bodies it is the Government’s responsibility to introduce complete legislation to achieve its aim for due scrutiny and agreement by Parliament. GPEW rejects the Government’s proposals for sweeping new powers of secondary legislation and so-called Henry VIII clauses as fundamentally undemocratic and an attempt to sidestep parliamentary sovereignty. GPEW resolves and asks its leaders and spokespeople to condemn these proposals publicly, to challenge the proposals and to fight against them at every opportunity.

Client Earth's Call for a New Clean Air Act

The Green Party strongly supports Client Earth’s call for a new Clean Air Act which would:

tackle sources of diesel;

safeguard legal protection which could be lost in the event the UK leaves the EU;

improve EU and UK law to enshrine the right to breathe clean air.

Further to Client Earth’s call for smog warnings during high pollution episodes: warnings should emphasise action to curb traffic rather than people’s everyday activities - the right of people to breathe clean air is paramount.

Following text quoted from ClientEarth:

"ClientEarth’s proposals for a Clean Air Act would:

Retain the objectives under the EU Ambient Air Quality Directive as a minimum safeguard on human health;

Adopt revised objectives based on World Health Organisation guidelines;

Guarantee the public the right to access the courts to enforce its provisions, in accordance with the Aarhus Convention. The procedure must be fast, affordable, allow for substantive review of air quality plans and policies and provide effective judicial remedies, including fines.

Consolidate the complex and disparate body of domestic, EU and international air pollution laws into one coherent and effective piece of legislation;

Clarify the roles and responsibilities of national government, local authorities, the Mayor of London and the devolved administrations;

Lay down a national framework for effective Clean Air Zones which phase out diesel and accelerate the shift to zero emission transport;

Implement the UK’s pollution reduction targets for 2020 and 2030 under the Gothenburg Protocol and the newly agreed EU NEC Directive, in order to tackle trans-boundary air pollution;

Ensure coherence with other relevant policies and legislation, particularly the Climate Change Act and planning guidance;

Require national, local and city authorities to collect adequate information on air pollution – including data from a minimum number of air quality monitoring stations – and proactively provide the public with that information, including through smog warnings during high pollution episodes; and

Require national, local and city authorities to take measures to reduce exposure to air pollution – particularly for vulnerable groups such as children, older people and those suffering from pre-existing health conditions."
