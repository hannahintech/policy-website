Record of Policy Statements (RoPS)

Israel’s Ground Invasion

Conference condemns Israel's ground invasion, aerial and marine bombing of Gaza, and calls on Green Party and Green Party elected representatives to take what steps they can to put existing Green Party policy into action and to ensure that the underlying causes are addressed, acknowledging there can be no lasting peace without justice.

Such steps include:

Reiterating our calls on the UN, the EU and the US government to ensure that Israel complies with international law;

Supporting these calls by active participation in the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign. This campaign aims to put pressure on the government of Israel to end the Occupation and to give equal rights to Palestinians. The campaign asks individuals, organisations, councils and governments to refuse to deal with companies and institutions identified as facilitating Israel's military capacity, human rights abuses or illegal settlement activity.

In particular to demand that the UK government halts all joint Israeli/UK military cooperation and approval for all arms sales to Israel.

Stop TTIP

The proposed EU-US trade deal, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, will be a disaster for the UK and for the EU. Green MEPs have been at the forefront of campaigns to stop TTIP and have voted against it. There has also been opposition from US Greens.

TTIP negotiations are being conducted with barely any public or democratic input or oversight. Although other trade deals have been negotiated beyond the reach of public scrutiny, the scale of TTIP makes its impact much greater and the need for public, democratic oversight even more urgent.

Big business has had excessive influence over the negotiations. In the preparatory phase, of the 590 meetings which took place between the EU Commission and lobby representatives, 92% were with representatives of private companies.

TTIP will undermine the rule of law by establishing a parallel justice system if it includes the proposed Investor-State Dispute Settlement mechanism (ISDS). ISDS gives powers to private arbitration panels to require compensation to private companies deemed to have suffered losses as a result of EU or national laws, with no recourse to appeal. ISDS will have a chilling effect on public policy, undermines democracy, and strengthens the power of private corporations.

The TTIP deal would lead to ‘harmonising’ of EU and US laws. This could lead to high standards in the EU or USA being lowered. This could have serious impacts on workers' rights, environment, animal protection and food safety standards, digital rights and financial regulation.

TTIP will make liberalisation and privatisation 'one way streets'. Returning public utilities, hospitals or waste collection to the public sector once privatised will be much more difficult or even impossible under TTIP. This represents a real threat to the NHS and other public services. Conference calls on the Green Party Executive, Greens elected to public office, and Green Party candidates and members to:

Support and sign the 'Stop TTIP' European Citizens' Initiative, which is launching in September, and which will require the EU Commission to take action if it receives one million EU signatures.[*]

Support and publicise the European Day of Action against TTIP on Saturday 11 October.

Call for MEPs and MPs from all parties to oppose TTIP

Advocate a fair and sustainable EU trade policy, based on the Alternative Trade Mandate coalition proposals.

Peace and Democracy in Ukraine

Conference condemns the diplomatic ineptitude and inaction which has allowed Ukraine to descend into death, division and devastation. We call on upon the UK government, and every member government of the UN security council to immediately call an emergency meeting of the UN security council. At that meeting a resolution should be proposed which:

Calls for an immediate permanent ceasefire

Calls for a peacekeeping force to be placed in areas at highest risk of renewed conflict

Calls for near immediate parliamentary elections, essential since the resignation of the last government

Calls for maximum international assistance for reconstruction, humanitarian and medical aid

Calls for UN monitors to ensure elections are free and fair.

Conference asks for GPEx to widely publicize this position, both nationally and internationally so that it gets the widest possible support.

Passed Autumn 2014

Health and Social Care Act

The Green Party seeks to repeal the 2012 Health and Social Care Act, and restore responsibility to the Minister of health to provide a comprehensive health service.

The Green Party seeks to repeal the right of the Minister of Health to close hospitals or hospital departments without effective public consultation.

Passed Autumn 2014

Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership

The Green Party of England and Wales believes that the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP),which aims at removing the regulatory differences between the US and the EU, is an assault on democracy. It would likely lead to the weakening of EU social and environmental legislation and ensure that new European legislation does not stand in the way of corporate interests. The Green Party will campaign against this agreement in order to protect legislation in areas such as environmental protection, workers' rights, health (including the NHS) and animal welfare and will make this issue a central part of its forthcoming European Parliament Election Campaign.
