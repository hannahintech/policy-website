# Local Planning and the Built Environment

[bs-toc depth="5"]

Background

LP100
There will always be competing demands for the finite resource of land. A free market in land would give undue power to wealthy landowners and rich buyers, and would lead to unsustainable patterns of development. This has been recognised since the establishment of the first green belt in 1935, and the introduction of the Town and Country Planning Act 1947.

LP101
However, the half century following the introduction of the Town and Country Planning Act 1947 has seen three policy failures. First, unsustainable patterns of development have prevailed, though less than if there were no planning controls at all. Of particular concern has been the development of prime agricultural farmland and important natural habitats, low density suburban sprawl that makes sustainable lifestyles difficult, and energy-inefficient buildings. Second, rising housing costs, overcrowding, a greater reliance on housing benefit, and fewer households being able to live near their place of work or their family. Third, and partly as a consequence of flawed national economic and industrial policies, in some parts of the country the permitted use of land for diverse and sustainable employment uses has been eroded by conversions to other uses.

LP102
While planning policy has failed to grapple with these national policy challenges, it is also often too remote from local communities. Decisions are not always taken at the most local practical level, consultation processes are too often tick-box exercises rather than an opportunity for genuine dialogue, and local decisions on local matters are overturned at a national level.

Principles

LP151
A revised National Policy Planning Framework, with social and environmental justice at its heart should be brought forward at the earliest opportunity. This NPPF will include (but not be limited to) energy plans, carbon budgets for buildings and construction, climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, strategies for the equitable provision of housing for all, the retrofit of the majority of our existing built environment in order to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with buildings, sustainable transport, and policies to seek to prevent the property and construction industries from driving inequality or unsustainable resource use. The national policy will set carbon and energy budgets for each bioregion/region.

LP152
Bioregional/regional strategies will be reinstated to include regional energy plans and carbon budgets, regional infrastructure strategies, housing provision targets, and policies specific to each region. These strategies will be created with regards to achievable operational and embodied carbon and energy minimum standards as set out in National Building Standards (currently National Building Regulations). Bioregional/regional strategies will be co-produced with the community to which they apply. The bioregional/regional strategies will set carbon and energy budgets for each local authority.

LP153
Local Plans will be co-produced by local authorities and local communities to give form to national and regional policies. Local Plans will be created with regards to achievable operational and embodied carbon and energy minimum standards as set out in National Building Standards. Local authorities will have an active role in identifying buildings and land for refurbishment and new build developments as well as different uses including material depots to enable a circular economy, providing infrastructure and drawing up the spatial plans for development.

LP154
The Green Party recognises that the built environment is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and that substantial changes are required to bring the sector in line with planetary limits.

LP155
The construction industry has the technical solutions necessary to realise a decarbonised built environment but requires an economic and legislative context to require it to do so.

LP156
Greenhouse gas emissions attributable to the built environment can be dramatically reduced with an extensive retrofit programme to upgrade cold, draughty, energy wasteful buildings.

LP157
The demolition and replacement of new buildings should only occur as a last resort if the refurbishment, modification and/or retrofit of existing buildings is impossible.

LP158
The Green Party recognises that the construction industry must become circular in terms of use of resources if it is to be sustainable within planetary limits.

LP159
Local and regional authorities would be adequately resourced in order to produce, manage, and enforce robust budgets and strategies.

LP160
In order to create a zero carbon infrastructure some areas of construction, such as housing retrofit and electricity system, will need to expand. To keep construction emissions down other areas of construction, such as new offices, shops, entertainment sites and warehouses, must be drastically reduced.

Long-term aims

LP201
To provide housing that is suitable for and affordable by local people as well as the land, infrastructure and facilities for work, education, healthcare, social and cultural activities as required by the community.

LP202
To protect land and green infrastructure providing other human uses that are essential to the national and local community, such as floodplains, farmland and national parks.

LP203
To reverse the harm caused by human development on other species, and to nurture a network of resilient habitats to reverse declining biodiversity, and protect people, land, and ecosystems from the impacts of severe weather events.

Short-term aims

LP300
To improve spatial patterns of development to meet sustainable transport and energy objectives, and to help communities adapt to the effects of climate change such as severe weather events.

LP301
To improve the permitted use of land to meet local needs such as housing and local manufacturing and production, without prejudicing long-term aims.

LP302
To re-introduce conservation practices in the design and construction and use of buildings. This should result in buildings which make maximum use of existing built fabric and structure (including foundations, superstructure, buildings in situ and reclaimed built fabric), and are built from low embodied carbon materials, designed to circular economy principles, and at least zero carbon in use.

LP303
To enable a greater degree of self-sufficiency to be achieved within the living areas than at present.

LP304
To strengthen and protect local decision making, and empower local communities to be genuinely involved in the development of local planning policy.

LP305
Short term actions to strengthen planning authorities’ ability to bring the built environment within planetary limits include:

Creating Neighbourhood Plans with climate justice at their heart and having them approved through local referendums to give them the status of local plans and in order to access funding eg Community Infrastructure Levy

Create Supplementary planning documents (SPDs) and/or Development plan documents (DPDs) to supplement existing local plans that recognise the climate emergency and empower the planning authority to consider planning applications in the context of a climate emergency.

LP306
To keep the environmental impact of construction activity and of the built environment within planetary boundaries.

Policies

Sustainable development

LP401
In practice, given the current unequal distribution of land, property and power, achieving
Local Planning and the Built Environment: LP150
onwards will inevitably mean that some with excessive wealth and power will lose out. Planning policy should seek to resolve these conflicts in the interests of greater equality.

LP402
While the Green Party aims to escape the need for growth in the economy and the social and environmental damage this growth entails, there will inevitably be requirements for the substantial refurbishment of existing as well as some provision of new infrastructure, housing stock, industrial and commercial assets, and social facilities in many local communities. Good planning and design are essential to resolve potential conflicts between social, economic and environmental concerns.

LP403
A sustainable built environment will be achieved through planning by creating places that facilitate a zero carbon, circular economy, with actions to mitigate and adapt to the climate emergency, to reduce our ecological footprint to a ‘one planet’ level, and to address more localised problems such as flooding, severe weather events, and heat islands. Local plans should integrate with national and bioregional/regional energy plans.

LP404
Achieving this requires a recognition that policies addressing all aspects of planning, including construction, housing, energy, transport, food, waste, water, health, the economy and natural habitats, are interconnected. More detailed policies in these areas are set out in other chapters. Local plans and neighbourhood plans (see
Local Planning and the Built Environment: LP504
) should seek to foster Lifetime Neighbourhoods, which offer everyone the best possible chance of health, well-being and social, economic and civic engagement regardless of age. Ensuring this means that communities are empowered, and that local shops and businesses, social and community facilities, streets, parks and open spaces, local services, decent homes and public transport are affordable and accessible to everyone now and for future generations.

LP405
The Green Party strongly supports land designations which prevent inappropriate development on National Parks, the Broads and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, natural habitats of local, regional, national or international importance, sites of special scientific or archaeological interest, and ancient woodlands.

LP406
Planning policy has failed to stem the alarming loss of biodiversity in England and Wales, and to arrest damage to ecology and landscapes, let alone to enhance them. The Green Party would require planning policy to protect and enhance ecology and biodiversity at a landscape scale, integrating this with policies on agriculture and industry.

LP407
Land designated as Green Belt should be used to contain urban sprawl, to maintain the separation of settlements, to protect prime agricultural land around settlements, to encourage urban regeneration and compact towns and cities, and to complement the ecological and cultural value of other designations. Green Belt should be used to make the sustainable built environment more resilient to flooding, make space for biodiversity, agriculture, energy production and sustainable transport in line with land use prioritisation set out in
Land: LD401
. The local authority role in reviewing and protecting their green belt is set out in
Local Planning and the Built Environment: LP510
.

LP408
The Green Party believes that the call-in powers of the Secretary of State and the Mayor of London, and the appeals system operated by the National Planning Inspectorate, undermine local democracy and confidence in the planning system. We would therefore:

bind the call-in powers of the Secretary of State so that they cannot override decisions in compliance with an up to date and approved local plan, except where the decision relates to national strategic infrastructure projects.

abolish the Mayor of London's power to call in and approve planning applications that have been refused by the local authority, or where the local authority has not yet made a decision.

restrict the role of the National Planning Inspectorate to examining local plans for compliance with national policy and alignment to national carbon budgets, abolishing its appeals process.

introduce a right of appeal for applicants and third parties, to be handled by a new body overseen by the Local Government Ombudsman, and only where there has been an error in the planning process, a variance from the local plan or national policy, or an infringement of civil rights.

LP409
The Green Party is concerned that viability assessments for local plans and for individual planning applications have put too much power in the hands of private developers, and led to the under-provision of affordable housing and other community benefits. This has been exacerbated by cuts to public investment in housing and infrastructure, a volatile development market, and excessively generous allowances for profits (often exceeding 20 per cent). We would therefore require that all viability assessments are published for public inspection, and that local authorities be required to set out clear guidance on developer profits with a maximum surplus of 15 per cent.

LP410
Permitted development rights are an important feature of the planning system, but in some cases these have been extended to inappropriate forms of development. The Green Party would roll back recent changes to permitted development rights including changes of use from commercial or industrial, and extensions onto or paving over front and back gardens where this exacerbates flood risk and biodiversity loss.

LP411
Demolition will be discouraged. Very small scale demolition will be permitted through revisions to permitted development rights, however all other demolition will require a full planning application or inclusion in a Local Development Order. Planning submissions will be required to include a study covering the social, economic and environmental impacts of all demolition work (including partial and full demolition of a building or structure), with reference to the local energy plan and buildings standards, as well as demonstrating how the demolished fabric will be reused, recycled or disposed of. The disposal of building materials will be subject to limitations as set out in the Green Party’s Natural Resources and Waste Policy (NR). In the case of social or co-operative housing, residents would be given the right to an indicative ballot to be included with a Statement of Community Involvement as part of the planning application.

LP412
Planning use classes should be used to ensure that the built environment meets the needs of the community. The index of classes will be set at national level and may include new use classes such as a use class for holiday homes (see
Housing: HO401
) and for categories of non built-environment land (see
Land: LD504
). Bioregional/regional strategies will include quotas for each use class to be determined via citizens assemblies and reviewed every two years.

LP413
All planning applications will be required to submit whole life carbon (including land use change emissions, where relevant, see
Land: LD501
,
Land: LD502
,
Land: LD504
and
Land: LD505
) and energy calculations (see
Economy: EC777
). These are to include embodied carbon and energy in both the up-front construction and anticipated maintenance, as well as the operational carbon and energy of the building in use. Embodied and operational carbon to be reported separately in kgCO2e/m2 and kgCO2e/m2/yr respectively. All planning permissions will be granted subject to a pre-commencement condition requiring updated whole life carbon and energy calculations based on construction information.

LP414
Developers who exceed their embodied or regulated (fixed building services and fittings including heating, cooling, hot water, ventilation and lighting) operational carbon budgets significantly without compelling reasons will face sanctions ranging from fines to permanent bans on applying for planning permission.

LP415
All design teams, contractors, suppliers, and others in the built environment supply chain subject to procurement standards (eg if tendering for a contract over a certain size) will be required to demonstrate environmental and social sustainability credentials. Such requirements are to be proportionate so as not to unfairly disadvantage sole traders and SMEs.

LP416
All approved planning applications will be subject to construction being carried out under a rigorous Quality Assurance process and subject to inspection to ensure the building’s energy performance matches design expectations. See section
Local Planning and the Built Environment: LP900
onwards for Building Standards.

Local plans

LP500
Local authorities should bring forward Local Plans, setting out a clear spatial vision which gives form to the principles set out in
Local Planning and the Built Environment: LP150
onwards and
Local Planning and the Built Environment: LP401-412
which complies with national policy; which is aspirational but realistic; and which is based on an understanding of the significance of place - what the community values about it and how they would like it to change in the future. Plans should be accompanied by a delivery strategy, setting out the scale and location of anticipated change, the likely sequence of development, and wider changes required to meet the objectives.

LP501
Both the Local Plan and its delivery strategy should be underpinned by a rigorous evidence base. This would include assessment such as carbon budgets, the availability of land, the requirements for housing (see
Housing: HO401-409
) and employment, the local ecology and ecosystems services, the historic environment, the landscape, and our changing climate. The Local Plan must stay within the bioregional/regional carbon budget.

LP502
Consultation on local Plans should begin early, and provide opportunities for local stakeholders to engage in a deliberative process to understand the evidence base and the challenges the local area faces; to identify the objectives and priorities for the plan; and to sketch the outline plans for each location. The Green Party would ensure that planning departments are adequately resourced for this task.

LP503
Where planning issues cross administrative boundaries, local authorities should face a duty to cooperate, which should take the form of a continuous process of engagement from initial thinking through to implementation. Where cooperation fails, an independent inspector will advise based on the process and outcomes. Where this still fails to achieve a common set of objectives and an implementation plan, the Secretary of State will make a ruling based on the inspector’s advice which will form a binding national policy on those local authorities.

LP504
Neighbourhood plans should enable each local community to express their own vision of a ‘lifetime neighbourhood’, defined as one where the social and physical conditions support a strong and vibrant community. Local planning authorities should seek to empower and support communities to develop their plans, ensuring they align with the strategic needs and priorities of the wider local area, national policy and legal requirements. Neighbourhood plans, therefore, must be in general conformity with the strategic policies of the Local Plan, and local authorities should therefore have a duty to assist communities in engaging in a deliberative process similar to that used in consulting on the Local Plan. Neighbourhood plans and local plans should seek to identify deficiencies in the components of a lifetime neighbourhood, for example areas with little access to open space and nature, and develop plans to address these. All neighbourhood plans should seek approval – from the local community in a referendum – so as to attain the same legal status as a local plan and enable local concerns to be enforceable

Identifying land for development

LP505
Local planning authorities have a duty to implement their Local Plans within the constraints of the existing built environment and land they oversee, and within carbon budgets and land use strategies set at national, regional and local levels. This provision should meet the need identified in housing strategies (see
Housing: HO401-409
).

LP506
As far as possible, the demand for new urban land should be minimised through a combination of demand-reduction policies (see for example
Housing: HO401
) and through optimising densities. Land value taxation would create incentives to bring forward empty brownfield sites for development, and local authorities would be given stronger powers to tackle remaining land hoarding (see
Local Planning and the Built Environment: LP516
). Any development of present settlements should be confined within the existing boundaries where possible, and where a loss of countryside is deemed necessary it should go on the least sensitive land that is most accessible by public transport, cycling and walking to existing economic and social facilities. The maximum environmental value should also be obtained on land used for development.

LP507
Local authorities should make use of existing buildings and small sites, which are often overlooked or undervalued in the current land availability assessments. Retrofitting existing building fabric and creating dense infill developments could significantly offset the need to build on larger brownfield and greenfield sites that provide natural habitats.

LP508
To protect wildlife, the Green Party would require any release of land for development to follow the mitigation hierarchy of ‘avoid, mitigate and compensate’. The impact on other natural habitats should be avoided wherever possible and where damage cannot be avoided it should be mitigated (e.g. via housing or infrastructure design, translocation of species or repair of damaged habitat). Finally, any unavoidable residual loss of replaceable habitat should be compensated through offsetting to ensure no net loss for biodiversity in and around the location of the development. Irreplaceable land uses as outlined in
Local Planning and the Built Environment: LP405
would not be subject to this offsetting policy. Developers should also look to understand and compensate for the social or amenity value of lost green space to local communities. The offset should be based on a robust, independently verified set of metrics. Links between housing, planning and environment strategies should be identified so that any offsetting contributes towards broader local and regional objectives.

LP509
While the policy of 'brownfield first' is supposed to consider the environmental value of brownfield sites, too many valuable habitats for other species are identified for development. The Green Party would give wildlife-rich brownfield land greater protection following the approach set out in
Local Planning and the Built Environment: LP508
, and require local authorities to review their local plans to remove sites with high environmental value.

LP510
Local authorities should review their green belt on a periodic basis where they are failing to achieve a sustainable built environment, for example where they are causing sprawl and commuting beyond their bounds, and where there is scope for a more sustainable built environment by building on existing green belt sites, for example near transport hubs. Reviews should seek to achieve the policies set out in
Local Planning and the Built Environment: LP406- 407
, ensure no net loss in the quantity and quality of green belt land, and should aim to 'green the greenbelt'.

LP511
The effects of the climate emergency will mean that it will no longer be practical for the continued use of some sites, including many homes, which are now liable to regular flooding. Such derelict land should be re-landscaped rather than re-developed, and the practice of developing reclaimed marshland should be ended. Central government should also help those who are most affected. Government insurance schemes should be available to offer cover for those refused flooding cover by commercial companies, and there should financial assistance to help with relocation for those whose properties have become uninhabitable or prohibitively expensive to insure.

LP512
Flooding in urban and rural settlements is a fact of life, and is set to get worse as our climate changes. Flood risk will change over time, and so should be regularly reviewed. Local plans should aim to reduce flood risks arising from all sources (rivers, tidal surges, sewers, groundwater, surface water and infrastructure failure). Individual developments should minimise the loss of permeable surface and increase it where possible. Where development entails a reduction of permeable surface area, it must mitigate the resulting increase in surface water runoff using Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDs) in accordance with policy
Housing: HO410d
. Loss of permeable surfaces in existing developments such as front and back gardens should be avoided. Planning consent will be required where an existing permeable garden is proposed to be converted to an impermeable surface which drains into conventional drains or a sewer. New green and blue infrastructure is not only cost effective, but also often good for air quality, biodiversity and health. Local plans should also identify opportunities for new flood defences.

LP513
Overheating in urban areas is a problem that is also set to get worse with our changing climate. Local plans should identify areas subject to a significant urban heat island effect, and set targets for urban greening to cool the air such that a changing climate makes the heat island effect no worse than it is today.

Bringing development opportunities forward

LP514
The Green Party would empower local authorities to use streamlined compulsory purchase powers to assemble areas with fragmented ownership, and to buy the land at existing use value. A greater proportion of land allocated to new homes should be made available for self-build. The Green Party would explore how the Land Bank and Community Land Trust models developed in the USA could be used to maximise the benefits from land and property acquisition.

LP515
Local authorities should then develop detailed plans for each development to include carbon budgets, provide the social, environmental and transport infrastructure, and promote good standards of design. They would then sell the land in small parcels for development by private, cooperative, charitable or publicly owned companies at a price that at least recovers their costs. Where this isn't possible, the local authority and national government should assess the social and environmental case for subsidising development.

LP516
To minimise land hoarding, local authorities should exercise compulsory purchase orders in the public interest. See also
Land: LD304
and
Land: LD508
.

LP517
For transparency the Land Registry will be publicly owned, complete and open to inspection (see
Land: LD301
). Local authorities would also be required to publish open data on planning permissions with some details of the plans. All other public authorities that collect data on transactions and options agreements would also be required to publish this in an open format. All public authorities considering disposal of land assets would be required to do so transparently, publishing its intention to do so, publishing key financial information after the land has been sold, and exploring options for other public or community bodies to purchase the land (see also
Housing: HO514
).

LP518
The Green Party would act to diversify the housebuilding industry. This would be achieved in large part through the parcelling of land into smaller plots (
Local Planning and the Built Environment: LP515
), bringing transparency to the land market (
Local Planning and the Built Environment: LP517
), and retaining public land in public or local community hands rather than selling it to big developers (
Housing: HO514
). We would also work with financial bodies listed in
Housing: HO606
to improve access to development finance for small and medium sized developers.

LP519
The Green Party would legislate to grant communities in England and Wales equivalent powers to those in Scotland to buy land. This would include rights to first refusal, and to compulsory purchase in cases where existing land uses are causing a detriment to the wellbeing of the local community. The Green Party would also give communities and councils the power to stop landowners sitting on or neglecting land by introducing Compulsory Sale Orders, enabling abandoned land to be brought back into community ownership.

Other land needs

LP520
In some parts of the country there is a shortage of provision for burials. At the same time there is an interest in woodland burial and other environmentally-friendly forms of burial. Local councils shall review the future need for burial space, to include provision for woodland and other environmentally-friendly forms of burial.

Local independent retailing

LP603
Many of the Green Party's policies on localisation and small enterprises will help local, independent retailers. These include the reduction of VAT on ecologically sustainable behaviours (eg insulation retrofit) (see
Economy: EC770d
) and combining National Insurance with Income Tax (see
Economy: EC721
), and some of our policies already seek to control parking in new developments (see
Transport: TR035
). However, some specific planning policies to preserve the viability of local shops and the services provided by these enterprises are also necessary.

LP604
We will revise the National Planning Policy Framework and its guidance so that local and regional authorities can protect and encourage local, independent retailers. This guidance would:

enable the introduction of ‘business conservation areas’ that empower local communities to retain the character and amenity of their high streets, and bar formula retailers from certain areas,

ensure basic facilities (food shops, banks, pharmacies and post offices) are located within all residential areas of a certain size; and ensure they are within 15 minutes’ walk in all urban and suburban areas, aiming for all such facilities to be within 5 minutes’ travel by foot or wheelchair; by empowering local authorities to use the planning process to influence the retail mix in their areas, and to offer subsidies or other incentives if necessary,

prohibit new out-of-town retail parks and car-based superstores,

insist that 50% of retail floor space in all new developments is affordable space for local small businesses,

reduce local authority dependence on financial incentives (‘planning gain’) from large developers and companies, which are used to secure planning permission for developments that would otherwise be rejected,

include clear policies on sustainability to enable planning authorities to favour local businesses on ecological grounds, rather than bigger firms with less sustainable practices,

prohibit new retail parking in large developments, apart from accessible parking,

encourage the pedestrianisation of shopping areas within cities, towns and villages, to provide a safe and pleasant shopping environment. Where possible, delivery access should be provided outside of the pedestrianised area or should be restricted to times which are not peak shopping times.

LP605
We will require local authorities to adopt a retail strategy, a retail regeneration plan and local competition policies to prevent high streets from being dominated by formula businesses, and to ensure fair market access for small, independent retailers. We would require these strategies to include policies to support and retain street markets and farmers markets, and encourage the introduction of new markets, where there is community demand.

LP606
We will empower local authorities to bring in rent controls for small shop premises, to prevent landlords from driving up rents and driving out independent retailers.

The built environment

LP701
Buildings of special historic interest need to be preserved for future generations. The present regulations and guidance for conservation areas and listed buildings should be improved to provide incentives for the retention of listed structures, and to protect or enhance the special historical character of conservation areas, however to also enable mass retrofit which will sometimes require overcladding of buildings and altering the appearance of some buildings within conservation areas. Listed buildings and traditional buildings in conservation areas should be retrofitted in a way which is sensitive to preserving heritage and taking account of their construction. Planning retrofit of traditional buildings should involve professional input prior to works taking place. Traditional building retrofit assessment should be carried out on a case by case basis and avoid damage buildings' structure and historic features and prevent worsening of moisture, internal environment and air quality issues. Since traditional buildings are considered 'higher risk' in terms of retrofit, it is accepted that there may be limits to the potential energy savings realisable. The benefits to future generations in preserving built heritage must be balanced with the prevention of harm to future generations by decarbonising the economy. Local authorities would be given a statutory duty to provide historic environment records.

LP702
Legal sanctions must be stiffened against those who demolish buildings, or who allow them to fall into a state of disrepair. The relevant bodies must make proper use of legislation enabling them to do this and must earmark sufficient resources, financial and staff, to operate it effectively. Interim protections would also be introduced to prevent the demolition of or damage to buildings that are being considered for heritage designation.

LP703
The Green Party would increase local authorities’ powers to take action in response to heritage at risk, including improvements to urgent works and streamlined compulsory purchase powers that reduce the risk to the local authority and increase the likelihood that the property would be saved and reusable.

LP704
All lighting of streets, roads and other outdoor public places should be of a "Warm White" specification.

Building Standards

LP900
The Green Party would review the Building Act to ensure that the Act and Building Regulations continue to apply during the first two years of occupation of the building (after the Final Certificate) such that building performance in use can be monitored and wherever possible brought closer in line with the design intention.

LP901
The Green Party would review existing building regulations and codes and introduce new regulations to require:

Retrofit, modification, and refurbishment of existing building fabric is generally preferred to new construction

All habitable space meets high standards of energy and water efficiency and avoids overheating during summer months without reliance on energy intensive cooling systems, taking account of projections for our changing climate. Building Regulations will require a fabric first approach for energy compliance using best available methods. Water efficiency standards would also be set for all buildings, taking account of current best practice.

Building standards are to be based on regulated operational energy and water use, not designed figures that may or may not be achieved. Unregulated energy (for example used for cooking, computers, tv etc) should also be included alongside regulated energy (for example for heating, hot water, lighting etc). Building standards will require (as per
Local Planning and the Built Environment: LP416
) quality assurance inspections to take place at intervals during construction.

The use of carbon-intensive materials must be dramatically reduced from current levels with lowcarbon materials such as timber and earth favoured over high-carbon materials such as steel and concrete

All construction is designed to Circular Economy principles

That the whole life carbon and energy of all retrofit and new construction is measured, reported, and within targets. Targets will be set to ensure carbon budgets can be met and will be achievable through the use of low-impact materials and reused and recycled built fabric, components and materials.

Drainage design must take account of the climate emergency, for example in preparing for a 1 in 100 year storm event. Care must be given to ensure that plants such as trees are given adequately sized pits to increase their resilience to the climate emergency.

All projects shall be required to deliver a structural report to include utilisation ratios of all primary structural members.

All projects shall be required to submit a design for disassembly strategy to include a methodology for safely accessing connections to enable the disassembly of all beams, columns, floor slabs, external and internal walls.

The Green Party support the restrictions on the use of combustible materials however these should apply to external wall construction only, to include plasterboard, sheathing boards, insulation, outermost cladding, and significant materials in balconies, brise soleil and similar building elements. The restrictions should not include the buildings primary structure such that the environmental benefits on timber construction (for example the use of cross-laminated timber) are not undermined. The primary structure should have adequate fire protection. The Green Party would fund research into the performance of structural timber when subject to real fire loads to ensure fire safety of timber structures is understood.

Minimum space standards based on the 'Parker Morris' standards, to improve residents' quality of life, ensure that homes are accessible, and are built to the Lifetime Homes standard so that they are able to accommodate changing personal circumstances and growing families. These standards should enable anyone with a disability to live in any home in Britain.

Comfort standards addressing ergonomics, sound, privacy and light, considering that light pollution can be harmful to both humans and biodiversity.

Consideration of the importance of the built environment for other species such as lichens, birds, bats and insects, avoiding impacts where possible and enhancing the local ecology as part of the local planning policy (see
Local Planning and the Built Environment: LP514
).

Provision of facilities to make sustainable lifestyle choices the easiest choice for occupants, for example in the provision of recycling bins and cycle parking.

LP902
All documentation associated with a development (eg structural reports, design for disassembly strategies, energy performance reports, fire safety information etc) should be held by the local authority alongside planning permissions and land registration information. Such information will be published in full and be publicly accessible.

LP903
The Green Party would ensure that local authorities and building control devote sufficient resources to enforce standards after construction. In particular, building control officers should be involved throughout the construction process to ensure standards are met. Standards will be based on measured performance through an accreditation scheme. Building control professionals will be required to undertake specific technical training on environmentally conscious construction as part of their accreditation and will be required to have Continued Professional Development in sustainability.

LP904
Built environment strategies should include condition surveys, assessing the existing stock against the standards set out in
Local Planning and the Built Environment: LP900
, with options for raising the quality of buildings that fail to meet the standards.

LP905
At the point when buildings are bought or relet, and where planning permission is sought for major changes, there will be a requirement for the owner to raise these standards to a reasonable degree.
