Record of Policy Statements (RoPS)

Animal welfare in public procurement

The Green Party believe that policy making around animals should be designed to protect them against cruelty. We don’t think it’s right to exploit the other species we share this planet with and are prepared to take on the vested interests that fuel animal cruelty.

We would support the initiative to ensure legislation on public procurement of explicit requirements to purchase higher-welfare animal products. We also separately encourage vegetarian and vegan menu options in all public sector establishments in order to reduce demand for animal products.

Agreed by GPRC September 2018

Climate Change Damages Declaration

The Green Party supports the Climate Change Damages Declaration calling for:

The establishment of an initiative for loss and damage finance with a two year work plan identifying sources of revenue adequate to the scale of the problem in a predictable and fair way;

the introduction of an equitable fossil fuel extraction charge – or Climate Damages Tax – levied on producers of oil, gas and coal to pay for the damage and costs caused by climate change when these products are burnt, implemented nationally, regionally or internationally

the use of the substantial revenues raised to be allocated through the appropriate UN body, such as the Green Climate Fund or similar financial mechanism, for the alleviation and avoidance of the suffering caused by severe impacts of climate change in developing countries, including those communities forced from their homes

the urgent replacement of fossil fuels, by mid-century at the latest, with renewable sources of energy assisted by increasing the rate of the Climate Damages Tax over time.

Agreed by GPRC July 2018

Good Systems Agreement between members of the Make VOtes Matter Alliance

The Green Party of England and Wales (GPEW) is a member of the
Make Votes Matter Alliance
, working with other parties, organisations and individuals to bring in a system of Proportional Representation for the House of Commons. By coming to cross-party consensus about what good voting systems look like, the Alliance will be in a stronger position to work together to achieve this goal.

The Make Votes Matter Alliance has pooled collective knowledge and carried out extensive research to agree the following principles which are required of ‘good’ voting systems. We have drawn on the work of official expert panels and consultations from around the world, a wide range of academic literature and a wealth of knowledge from other expert sources.

The overriding objective is to ensure that the seats won in Parliament are in proportion to the votes cast.

This agreement is not intended to alter allies’ existing system preferences, but to seek broad consensus about the key principles that any voting system considered for UK general elections must meet.

As such, GPEW confirms its support for voting systems that meet the following principles:

Principles of good voting systems for general elections:

Proportionality
: good systems ensure that seats closely match votes, with parliamentary representation at least as proportional as the Scottish Parliament.

Representation
: good systems ensure MPs and governments represent the views of the voters.

Equal votes
: good systems ensure the value of individual votes is not distorted by factors such as geography, and minimise the need for tactical voting.

Local links:
good systems maintain links between MPs and specific geographic areas.

Diversity
:good systems encourage the election of parliaments reflecting the population.

Voter choice
: good systems allow voters a wide choice of parties, and allow voters to express preferences for people rather than just parties. Any lists used must be democratically determined.

Accountability
: good systems ensure MPs and governments are accountable to the voters.

Balance of stability and flexibility
: good systems engender stable, flexible government that has the ability to compromise.

Sustainability and adaptability:
good systems are able to respond and adapt to changing needs without requiring frequent or fundamental change.

Voting simplicity
: good systems and ballot papers are easy for voters to understand and use.

Green Jobs Alliance Statement

Greener Jobs Alliance Joint Statement on Just Transition in the UK

Early supporters of this statement include Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, Greener Jobs Alliance, People & Planet, PCS, NUS, National Education Union.

It's time for a Just Transition in the UK, moving to a modern low carbon economy in such a way as to protect workers' livelihoods, create new industries and deliver a fairer society in all regions and devolved nations. The need for action to support the UN's Sustainable Development Goals and Paris Climate Change Agreement to keep global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees, is urgent if we are to avert the environmental and economic costs of climate change.

We share a concern that the Government's Industrial and Clean Growth strategies fail to reference the need for a Just Transition. This embodies the principles of consultation between all sections of society; investment in skills and jobs; the creation of decent work; and social protection for individuals and communities, particularly those reliant on fossil fuels. It is necessary to confront the danger facing our industries and power system as employment in traditional sectors declines. Workers, if losing their job in these sectors, should be able to retrain and redeploy to a new job on equivalent terms and conditions, covered by collective agreements, and fully supported in their housing and income needs through transition.

Government must take a decisive lead with plans to transform key sectors, through publicly and community owned energy supply, transport infrastructure, investing in energy efficiency and sustainable heating in our homes and in industry. The speed and scale of Government action must be increased, as advised by the Committee on Climate Change. Where necessary to secure change at sufficient pace and scale, options for public and community ownership or partial stakes in flagship energy projects and enterprises should be pursued.

Employment and social benefits for communities most affected by industrial change should be secured through local investment in new jobs and skills, the creation of local supply chains, and 'community benefit' clauses in public contracts and local ownership. The principles of social justice and equity must be adopted to ensure no-one is left behind in the transition to economic and environmental sustainability.

Meanwhile, internationally, the government should support the strengthening of workers' rights and environmental standards in the global supply chains for low carbon industries, such as solar panel and battery production.

We believe that all key stakeholders should be represented on consultation and implementation bodies linked to the industrial, skills and climate change strategies. This should include proposed industrial and sector bodies at national, regional and local levels

We therefore call on the UK government to:

incorporate Just Transition principles within the UK's commitments to implement the Paris Agreement, including the UK's Industrial and Clean Growth strategies.

legislate for the right to appoint workplace environment representatives to help ensure workers' views are fairly represented at local level. At company and sector level unions need the right to a voice in the economic restructuring decisions that will take place.

establish a Just Transition Commission to develop a shared understanding of the challenges and opportunities ahead, along the lines of the welcome initiative of the Scottish Government to establish such a body.

Greens reject Labour affiliation

Conference notes calls by journalists such as Owen Jones for the Green Party to affiliate with the Labour Party.

Conference further notes that:

Greens have won many concessions from Labour administrations that could not have happened from within Labour,

Local authorities need effective opposition and affiliation would leave many without effective opposition,

Elected Greens are often the only viable opposition to Conservative administrations,

Labour's policies and actions on HS2, nuclear weapons and power, airport expansion, homelessness, libraries, estate demolition, the scapegoating of immigrants, tree felling, and more are not compatible with Green values,

Labour does not support Proportional Representation, which is a high political priority for the Greens,

Greens do not believe large broad coalition parties give voters enough choice nor that they produce effective government and are therefore not conductive to a good democracy,

Labour's internal democracy is woeful and not compatible with our members' expectations of democratic policy making,

The whipping system employed by Labour is not conductive to cooperative policy making and is not compatible with expectations of elected Greens,

Labour does not support the Green policy of a ratification referendum on the terms of any Brexit deal,

The Cooperative Party has not been able to present its own unique identity whilst affiliated to Labour, and has therefore had less influence over Labour than the Greens, and therefore rejects affiliation to Labour.

Conference calls for Labour to implement Proportional Representation for elections to Westminster as the basis for further cooperation between our two, separate and distinct, parties.
