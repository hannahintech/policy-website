Record of Policy Statements (RoPS)

Zero Carbon Homes and Passivhaus Standards

Green Party Conference notes:

The government cancelling the introduction of Zero Carbon Home Standards in 2016

The negative impact this will have on householders at risk of fuel poverty in new housing

The missed opportunity to reduce carbon emissions in new developments

The loss of income to the local economy as a result of these lower energy efficiency standards, as householders’ income is spent paying energy bills rather than in local shops and on local services

Green Party Conference believes:

That under the principle of ‘localism’ councils can determine their own standards on land that they own if those standards comply with UK Building Regulations

That the internationally recognised ‘Passivhaus Standard’ offers an alternative to the UK’s diminished energy efficiency ambitions for new-build housing

That the Passivhaus standard complies with UK Building Regulations and can deliver heating bills of less than £100/year for the average three bedroom terrace

Green Party Conference agrees:

To call on all Local Parties to campaign to specify Passivhaus Standards on all buildings on Council-owned land and as a condition of sale on any council land

Passed Autumn 2015

Green EU campaign

Conference notes:

That the Queen's Speech in May announced that a Referendum will take place by the end of 2017.

That the EU Referendum Bill is currently being debated in Parliament.

The Green Party has a long standing policy of wanting a referendum on EU membership, remaining in the EU, and pushing for major reforms.

The European Union is in urgent need of reform to make it more democratic, sustainable and accountable.

The Green Party is an internationalist party. We believe in working across borders to solve the shared challenges we face.

The recent members survey stated that 78% of members consider the UK’s membership of the EU ‘a good thing’ while only 6% think it ‘a bad thing’.

That Green MEPS use their position in the European Parliament to make EU institutions more democratic and accountable – and to vote against damaging policies which harm workers and the environment.

That the Green Party has been at the forefront of the fight against damaging free trade deals – including TTIP.

Conference instructs:

The Green Party to run a distinct Green campaign in favour of the EU in addition to cross-party campaigning. The Green campaign should highlight our support for an EU which, among other things, helps protect workers’ rights, tackles climate change and promotes peace.

GPEX and elected representatives to use the referendum campaign to highlight the major reforms we need to the EU, and to bring about a better understanding and engagement among members of the public of how the EU works and how they can influence it, including through the election of MEPs

GPEX and elected representatives to work together with Green Parties in other EU countries and other partners to build the campaign for real reform in the EU both during the referendum campaign and after.

GPEX and elected representatives to look at forming campaigning partnerships with grassroots organisations, like-minded politicians and others.

Passed Autumn 2015

NHS Reinstatement Bill

The Green Party will campaign to restore fully the NHS as an accountable public service providing health services free at the point of delivery by reversing 25 years of marketization in the NHS by abolishing the purchaser-provider split, ending contracting and re-establishing public bodies and public services accountable to local communities. The Green Party supports the 'NHS Reinstatement 2015' Bill proposed by Professor Allyson Pollock et al.

Passed Spring 2015

Demand and Supply Management in the National Health Service

Demand management will be maximised through prevention of illness and appropriate care of the chronically ill. Demand for hospital services will be managed through the best use of community services and through caring for patients as close to home as is safely possible.

Education of patients will be used to limit demand on healthcare services. National campaigns will encourage people not to automatically seek healthcare with self-limiting conditions like common cold, cough, sore throat, diarrhoea and vomiting, and flu-like illness. Information will be available to help people self-manage these conditions, and to recognise when they should seek help. There will be a strong message to discourage the practice of going to work, or to any other social situation, when a person is suffering from a contagious illness such as flu-like illness.

Because of the escalating cost of healthcare there will always be insufficient funds to meet expectations of patients. This necessitates rationing. Where necessary this should be open and democratically accountable, rather than arbitrary and unfair as it is now.

Passed Spring 2015.

Private Healthcare

The Green Party is opposed to private health provision in principle, Greens are opposed to a transfer of resources away from the public health system which is available to all. While private health insurance still exists, it should be a taxable employment benefit where offered.

Passed Spring 2015.

Opposition to 'third way' health reform

We actively oppose and seek to reverse any public service health policy reforms which lead to:

a two- or multi-tier health service with uneven standards and service provision,

further disconnection of the service from public accountability - via local, regional or national government,

the undermining of a fully integrated NHS, publicly funded and committed to high quality universal provision with free services at the point of use, or

creeping privatisation.

Passed Spring 2015.
