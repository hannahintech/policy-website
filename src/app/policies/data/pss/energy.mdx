# Energy

[bs-toc depth="5"]

Introduction

EN001
The aim is a decarbonised energy system based on efficient use of electricity and heat from renewable sources within the UK providing security of supply and replacing fossil fuels.

EN002
Producing and using energy is a major source of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore the energy system must address the temperature targets of the 2015 Paris agreement on Climate Emergency and targets in the Climate Change chapter, taking into account fairness within and between nations.

EN003
The principal objective is to decrease overall energy use to the minimum possible through improved efficiencies, changes in materials and reductions in overall consumption.

EN004
Democratic control of the energy system will be enhanced, together with fair, affordable and equal access to energy and the goods and services it provides.

EN005
Transformation of the energy system will bring with it significant health benefits, improved social well-being and environmental safeguards. The positive economic effects on employment and across all sectors of the economy will be maximised.

EN006
Changes to the energy system will take into account population growth and demographic change, changing behaviour patterns, changes in transport and assist adaptation to changing weather and climate.

EN007
Central and local government will collaborate in developing energy plans in consultation with local communities and businesses, setting energy and emission targets for buildings, industry and transport to encourage very low carbon energy use.

Power

EN010
In line with the move from fossil fuels, clean electricity generation will be substantially increased, based primarily on renewable, very low carbon sources with offshore wind as a major source, supported by onshore wind, marine, solar photo-voltaic, biofuels, hydro power and geothermal.

EN011
Continuity of supply will be ensured by using the UK’s renewable energy sources and a variety of storage technologies, links to other countries’ grids and minimal use of natural gas to balance demand and supply, and consistent with meeting demand in real-time. Surplus electricity will be transformed into heat and gas and stored (power to gas), or exported.

EN012
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) infrastructure, including a network, will be established to ensure decarbonisation of power supply by natural gas, assist industrial decarbonisation, and as a basis for future carbon sequestration.

EN013
Change in the organisation of energy transmission and distribution will be accelerated to cater for increases in dispersed energy sources, demand side management and storage.

EN014
Nuclear power, coal and incineration of waste will be phased out.

EN015
Biofuels will be sustainably sourced within the UK, and therefore the quantity available will be limited. (See
Forestry: FR700
).

EN016
Hydrogen will be produced from excess renewable electricity generation by electrolysis. The Green Hydrogen produced - along with synthetic fuels derived from it - will have a role in electricity generation (
Energy: EN010
), industry (
Energy: EN030
) and transport (
Energy: EN041
). Production of hydrogen from fossil fuels will be phased out.

Buildings

EN020
Large-scale refurbishment programmes will be carried out to greatly increase the energy efficiency of existing buildings.

EN021
Heating of buildings will be transformed by the use of solar thermal, heat pumps, biofuels, stored heat, electricity and geothermal. The use of natural gas for heating will be phased out entirely.

EN022
New buildings will be built to be energy efficient and to have low embodied carbon. This will be achieved through the Planning system (see
Local Planning and the Built Environment: LP151-152
,
Local Planning and the Built Environment: LP413-414
).

Industry

EN030
Industrial processes will be transformed to be more efficient. Renewable heat, hydrogen and relevant derived synthetic fuels, and very low carbon electricity will be prioritized over the use of fossil fuels.

EN031
Change to low carbon energy processes will be encouraged by incentives to avoid long-term lock-in of high-carbon technologies.

EN032
Use of the CCS infrastructure, established for power, will be encouraged where removal of fossil fuel energy is not practical.

Transport

EN040
Walking, cycling, rail and public transport will be the main substitute for car travel (see Transport chapter).

EN041
Cars and vans, and later HGVs, will become increasingly based on ultra-low emission engines using batteries and fuel cells (utilizing power to gas); electrification will proceed in step with deployment of clean energy sources.

EN042
Electrification of rail, coach and bus services will continue.

EN043
Energy efficiency standards for internal combustion engine vehicles will be set reflecting real life conditions, and progressively tightened.

EN044
Air travel will be radically discouraged.

EN045
Greater efficiency in sea transport will be encouraged to minimise energy use per tonne/km.

Research, Development and Demonstration (RD&D)

EN050
Research will be continued into the best technologies and processes to address the energy system considering cost, timescale, governance and function.

EN051
Substantial RD&D will be made available to promote large-scale cost-effective deployment especially for marine power, energy storage, building energy performance improvements including insulation, techniques and technologies, HGVs, CCS and shipping.

Skills and Training

EN060
The workforce needed to implement these changes will be developed through extensive national and local programmes covering construction, transport, manufacturing and energy at all skill levels and to the wider public.

Social Well Being and Health

EN070
Fuel poverty will be addressed by a comprehensive range of policies, including home energy improvements and grants, and related policies on income, health, and housing as well as energy pricing and regulation.

Finance

EN080
A carbon tax will be applied at a level high enough to encourage the shift from fossil fuels to renewables at the speed and scale required.

EN081
Transformation of the energy system at the right speed and scale will require funding from general taxation, in combination with private finance; all fossil fuel subsidies will be removed.

EN082
Incentives will address particular challenges in the energy system, including HGVs and industrial plant.

EN083
Partnership between energy users and producers will be encouraged in order to assist energy management at all levels.

EN084
Financial instruments to assist efficiency measures will be developed.

Legislation and Regulation

EN090
Regulation will play a large part in ensuring each sector of the economy is energy efficient and to ensure the deployment of very low carbon devices and systems.

EN091
Regulations will ensure all new buildings are built to the best energy and carbon performance standards and are monitored in use.

EN092
Wildlife, landscape and heritage will be safeguarded and air quality improved as the energy system changes.

EN093
Existing policy frameworks will be reviewed, and following consultation, will be changed to reflect the increased ambition.

EN094
Fair competition will be ensured to encourage diversity of ownership of the energy system including public, municipal and community schemes.

EN095
Energy regulation will be aimed at helping to achieve environmental and social objectives, and a fair and accountable energy sector.

International

EN110
Border tariffs and bans will be applied to discourage and avoid imports of products with high embodied energy/emissions.

EN111
Transfer of leading UK energy technologies around the world will be ensured, and international action promoted to ensure higher efficiency standards.

EN112
The UK will take a leading part in capacity-building in developing countries as part of international aid, as well as in international efforts to reduce GHG emissions.
