Record of Policy Statements (RoPS)

Community Pubs, Pub Goers and Alcohol Policy

The pub and brewing industries are in crisis. Every day seven pubs close and small brewing companies struggle to find business, while the market is dominated by four global companies. Tie licensees can currently only buy a  limited range of beer at prices inflated by around 40%. This restricts pub goers’ choice, prevents small local brewers selling to such pubs and hastens pub closures. We believe that an effective approach to reduce alcohol related harm must involve support for good community pubs which provide a safe and responsible place for people to drink.

Therefore, the Green Party of England and Wales supports CAMRA's Beer Drinkers and Pub Goers Charter and will campaign to:

Promote the interests of Britain's 15 million regular pub goers.

Champion the community importance of well-run pubs

Support the rebalancing of alcohol taxation to protect well- run community pubs, small brewers and traditional cider producers.

Reform “beer tie” arrangements to ensure a fair deal for consumers, allow local brewers to sell their beers to local pubs and deliver a sustainable future for Britain's pubs.

Seek to address issues of alcohol-related harm through a more targeted approach that supports pubs which  play a positive role in community life and provide a safe and responsible place to enjoy a drink.

In particular the party agrees that;

GPEx should contact CAMRA and the GMB union to inform them of our support for the Charter and for a radical reform of “beer tie” arrangements.

Control over the change of use and demolition of pubs should be brought into the hands of local people by giving Local Authorities greater power over planning.

The Sustainable Communities Act 2007 should be extended to provide a rolling programme allowing local people to continue to submit proposals to the Government to protect their local small brewers, traditional cider producers and community pubs.

Supermarkets should abide to the same high standards as ontrade alcohol suppliers, and end the selling of alcohol as a lossleader.

That the promotion of community pubs should be the cornerstone of a strategy to promote responsible drinking and preventing anti-social behaviour. Pubs which act as hubs of their community should be given 50% mandatory business rate relief as recognition of their value to society.

Supports beer as a low alcohol product, creating a zero duty rate for beers of 2.8% abv and below.

Support for the retention of small breweries' relief.

Change to the legislation on short beer measures (it is not currently illegal to serve customers less than a full pint in a pub) so beer drinkers are not short changed.

Support the changes to the 2003 Licensing Act which provide for greater flexibility in pub opening times and greater choice for pub goers.

Supports the revision of the EU Excise Duty Directive allowing the UK Government to introduce a preferential duty rate for all alcoholic drinks sold in pubs.

Supports radical reform of the “beer tie” to ensure equity in the relationship between large pub companies and licensees, including the provision of a guest beer right. Currently “tied” licensees can only buy a limited range of beer at inflated prices, often up to 40% higher. This limits pub goers’ choice, prevents small breweries selling to tied pubs, and hastens pub closures.

An amendment to current compulsory purchase orders so that when a community pub is being sold the community and current lessee are given an opportunity to buy.
