# Forestry

[bs-toc depth="5"]

Background

FR100
A successful, thriving and well-managed UK forestry and woodlands estate will be achieved through the application of ecosystem and silvicultural principles, to enhance the ecology, landscape, monetary and health economy, whilst mitigating CO2 and the climate emergency risks.

Objectives

FR200
Increase the area of cover in the UK to be between 30% and 40% in 10 years, meeting these forestry objectives within the context of the land use outcomes (See
Land: LD200
):

Sustained cooperative relationship between public and private estates

UK net self-sufficiency in forestry products to displace some fossil fuel based products (e.g. plastics).

Optimise the quantity and quality of all forest products.

Increase the involvement, employment and enjoyment of local communities.

Maintain and protect ancient woodland and priority habitats as well as increasing biodiversity, abundance and soil health.

Protect and increase the Public Forest Estate (PFE).

Increase the area of fruit and nut trees

Increase the biomass of living trees for carbon sequestration and remove pinewood from peatland to eliminate emissions

Allow for the use of forest residue and waste wood as well as limited plantation for energy.

Policy

Forest and Woodlands within national and local government

FR300
A Green Government will create an independent publicly funded 'UK Forestry and Woodlands Council' (UKFWC), to hold an advisory role to all UK ministries and agencies.

FR301
A Green Government will introduce Local Forestry Coordinators (LFC), as employees of the local authority/local representative of the UKFWC, advising and liaising with communities and the sector.

The Public Forestry Estate (PFE)

FR400
A Green Government will ensure that the PFE remains in public hands and will be constituted as land held in trust for the nation, with Trustees and Ministers accountable to Parliament.

FR401
The expansion of the UK estate/tree cover shall be driven through three component parts (in addition to other policy levers described in
Land: LD502
).

Forest Services, to manage the land cover of the PFE, allocate grants, enforce regulations and implement and police pest control

Forest Research, to oversee and coordinate research through the PFE, academia and the commercial sector

Forest Enterprise, to manage the PFE sustainably, plant, grow and fell standing timber, sustain balanced supply chains and encourage access.

Charitable Trusts & Estates

FR500
The Church Commissioners, the Church of England dioceses, the Crown Estates, and trusts such as the National Trust, RSPB, Wildlife Trusts, Woodland Trusts and significant private estates will be required to facilitate the creation of forestry and woodland serving biodiversity, energy, construction and social needs.

Increasing Forest Cover

FR600
An increase in overall tree cover shall be facilitated so that it achieves the objective in
Forestry: FR200
, consisting of unmanaged forest and woodland; harvested forest and woodland; unharvested (but managed) forest and woodland; woodland; open canopy woodland; and agroforestry.

FR601
There will be a strong presumption against the permanent removal of woodland; any loss (e.g. any removal of inappropriate forestry) will be balanced by equivalent forest and woodland creation elsewhere, under the ultimate supervision of the UKFWC.

FR602
In particular, there will be a strong presumption to protect ancient woodland cover and veteran trees, both in rural and urban environments.

FR603
Furthermore, the planting of new forest and woodlands will be prioritised towards Grades 4 and 5 agricultural lands and land classified as 'severely disadvantaged'.

Energy Forestry

FR700
Planting of short rotation forestry and coppice for energy production shall be facilitated, where land use priorities allow. (See
Land: LD401
).

FR701
Forest and sawmill residues can be used for energy production, but only if they are not better applied to preserving forest soil health and sequestering carbon, increasing biodiversity or producing other wood products.

Building and Packaging Materials

FR800
Supporting Green Party Industrial Policies
International: IP202
and
International: IP241
, and the climate emergency policy
Climate Emergency: CC260
, a Green Government will work to reduce UK imports of timbers and wood products that can be grown in the UK to zero, and also promote a 'Wood First' policy in all new buildings and in retrofitting existing ones.

FR801
A Green Government will work to facilitate the provision of sustainable and non-polluting packaging and fencing, maintain a regular output, and encourage the replacement of oil-based packaging with wood products that do not meet construction grades.

Biodiverse Ecosystems

FR900
A Green Government will work to maintain, enhance and restore forest ecosystems' resilience and multi-functionality, to provide key environmental services, including flood mitigation, air, soil and water quality.

FR901
Elected Greens will work to introduce a moratorium on the sale of ancient woodland from the PFE, as defined under the Ancient Woodlands Inventory.

FR902
Elected Greens will work to amend the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) to exclude 'biodiversity offsetting'.

FR903
Elected Greens will encourage rewilding in certain areas to encourage natural regeneration.

FR904
A Green Government will promote appropriate planting to enhance biodiversity, both within woodland cover and related habitats, particularly understory.

FR905
Areas of unharvested forestry in the UK will be enhanced and increased (in consultation with devolved governments), with strong measures for protection in perpetuity, as per
Wildlife and Habitats: WH120
and subject to
Forestry: FR601
, to support the targets in the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, as per policy numbered
Wildlife and Habitats: WH104
. This will be achieved by state funding and planning policies.”

Biosecurity

FR1000
A Green Government will recognise the significance of this critical area of research. This will include aspects such as improving the regulation and practice of biosecurity, embracing the Biosecurity Continuum, ensuring the updating and analysis of the risk register, improving training Border Agency staff in identifying problem plants and products, and including biosecurity management in relevant course curricula and increasing the capacity of Plant Health Services.

Building a Wood Culture

FR1100
A Green Government will promote access for children and young people into wooded areas, and ensure schools across England and Wales are fully aware of the roles available in forestry. Forest schools will be encouraged.

FR1101
A Green Government will ensure that forest ecosystems and management are incorporated into school curricula; in Further and Higher Education there will be encouragement to include wood, forest and woodland cover into relevant subject areas.

Public Access and Health Benefits

FR1200
A Green Government will work to ensure that no person lives more than 500m from green spaces with trees and encourage community woodland.

FR1201
Elected Greens will work to promote the health and well-being benefits of access to trees and woodlands.

FR1202
Elected Greens will work towards maintaining and improving current levels of public access, and pay special attention to community and urban woodland within the planning process.

Standards

FR1300
In enacting this policy elected Greens recognise the UK Forestry Standard (UKFS), the Programme for Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), the Forest Stewardship Council's (FSC), UK Forestry Stewardship Standard (UKFSS) and the UK Woodland Assurance Standard (UKWAS) for forestry and woodland management; the Woodland Carbon Code for sustainable forest-carbon sequestration management; the Grown in Britain licence for ensuring provenance; the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) for chain of custody and the Soil Association Organic Standards for Woodland.

Research & Development

FR1400
Funding shall be provided for innovative and targeted research, including different timber species’ strengths and utility; CO2 sequestration potential, future planting needs and species suitability under climatic changes; mapping research on land areas most suited to energy production, food growing, urban growth and conservation; planting opportunities mapping; research into organic pest control; climate emergency adaptation and resilience opportunities, particularly flood mitigation (See
Land: LD503
).
