Housing and Retrofit

• The increase in social housing would be supported by a national housing fund provided by the UKIB (UK Infrastructure Bank)

• Local authorities should be borrowing to build more council housing (within prudential limits) with rents being funneled back into debt repayments. 

• Introduce a Community Right to Buy for private rental properties that the landlord wishes to sell; any property that hasn’t been insulated to EPC rating C or fails to meet the decent homes standard; all former social housing bought under the right to buy; any property that is left empty for more than six months. Extrapolation of 

• Introduce a national landlord and rental property licensing scheme and an enhanced Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS). 

• Facilitate street-by-street retrofit requires by guaranteeing loans tied to the property. 

• Tenants of private landlords will have the right to insist their landlords access property linked finance for their homes. 

• Insulation including adaptation to extreme heat 

• Rent controls. 

A national housing fund 

The increase in social housing would be supported by a national housing fund provided by the UKIB (UK Infrastructure Bank). This fund would allow the crowding in of private institutional, environmental social governance (ESG) investment. The planning constraints introduced in parallel to ensure development was in balance with the UK carbon budget would limit the opportunities for investment in private house building.

Social housing provision based on need 

Local authorities will be expected and funded to assess both their social housing need, availability/ suitability of existing housing stock and the sites suitable for new social housing. The survey of need will need to assess both volume and type, ensuring that the needs of the elderly, families with children, people living with a disability or requiring support through sheltered housing are adequately catered for. The Government working through Councils and other providers will deliver up to 150,000 social housing units a year through various measures including new build and refurbishment. New build sites will be acquired using quick turnaround compulsory purchase powers if necessary for homes and public services as well as shops. This will include areas of land, that once serviced, will be offered to private house builders to ensure that mixed communities are delivered. Local authorities should be able to borrow (within prudential limits) to pay for the land and building. Rents paid into the local authority; housing revenue account would be allowed to be funneled back into debt repayments.

Buy the supply 

Local authorities have already bought existing homes to increase their stock of social housing. This is currently being done on the open market with no enhanced leverage to reflect the wider social and economic benefits that can come from an increase in the supply of social housing. 

Local authorities leverage in the market should be supported by the following:

A community right to buy for private rental properties that the landlord wishes to sell, this would give a first option to buy to local authorities, registered social landlords and community housing groups. 

A community right to buy on any for sale private rental property that hasn’t been insulated to EPC rating C or fails to meet the decent homes standard this would give a first option to buy to local authorities, registered social landlords and community housing groups. 

A community right to buy on any for sale property that was formerly social housing and bought under the right to buy this would give a first option to buy to local authorities, registered social landlords and community housing groups. This would be irrespective of when the property had been purchased under the right to buy. 

A community right to buy on any property that is left empty for more than six months would give a first option to buy to local authorities, registered social landlords and community housing groups. 

The purchase of these homes would be supported by the national housing fund provided by the UKIB. 

A national landlord and rental property licensing scheme 

A national register of both landlords and rental property would deliver clarity for tenants and a significant tool for local authority enforcement of an enhanced Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS). Local authority's grants will be adjusted adequately to carry out the inspection and licensing of both property and landlords. 

Gaining community support for retrofitting 

A national programme of information and support will be set up to communicate the benefits of retrofit and to support the public through the support that is available This programme will include: 

Show homes demonstrating how retrofit can improve their living standards. 

How to live with new technology like heat pumps. 

How to access finance and get your landlord to access finance. 

How to access training and work retrofitting your community. 

Ensuring that controls for heat pumps are accessible for everybody. 

Financing retrofit 

Public expenditure on retrofit of privately owned homes needs to be supplemented by contributions from the owners of properties. 

Street by street retrofit requires easy access to financing irrespective of the current financial situation of homeowners. 

This will be achieved via property linked finance. The loans will be tied to the property. When the properties change hands the loan repayments will move to the new owner. 

The loans will be government backed and secured on the property. They will be considered an Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investment. These factors will enable a lower interest rate than is usual for a loan to an individual for home improvements. 

Tenants of private landlords will get the right to insist their landlords access property linked finance for their homes. Landlords will not need to provide any upfront finance but will be responsible for the repayment of the loans. 

Minimum insulation standards 

Landlords in the private rental sector would be expected to ensure that their properties meet minimum energy efficiency standard insulation EPC C by 2026 and EPC B by 2030. 

Properties that do not meet those standards would be unable to be legally let to new tenants. 

Rent controls 

The Green Party would bring in rent controls to achieve a ‘Living Rent’. Rents in a locality would take up no more than 35% of the local median take-home pay and in implementing any controls we would strike a balance between affordability and predictability for tenants, and the landlords’ need to invest in their homes and make a reasonable profit. The decisions in any locality would be under local or regional government control. 

Adapting homes to extreme heat 

As a part of any retrofit program for insulation, homes assessed to be dangerous in heatwaves would be fitted with passive measures to reduce internal heating. These would include but not be limited to blinds, shutters and external shades.

Action on Covid and Long Covid 

The Green Party of England and Wales believes that the Government should follow expert advice and immediately act to: 

Improve air quality in public indoor spaces such as schools, hospitals, public transport, and workplaces to mitigate risks of infection 

Equip our NHS to provide safe environments for patients and staff 

Restore free lateral flow testing and re-instate supported isolation protocols for infected people, their carers, and family members 

Support research into improved vaccines and therapeutics, and set up a post-viral chronic illness research taskforce to improve understanding and treatments of Long-COVID, ME and chronic fatigue syndromes.   Implement a comprehensive, safe, evidence-based vaccination and booster programme.

Net Zero Governance 

GREEN PARTY OF ENGLAND AND WALES
Response to the Call for Evidence on Net Zero Governance. 27 August 2021 

It is clearly essential to reduce net global emissions to zero. This, however, is not enough. Climate change is already causing unacceptable harm and the harm is mainly due to the total emissions to date, especially of CO
2
, not to current emissions. So it will continue until we have removed a significant fraction of the greenhouse gases from the air. So the UK’s long-term aim must be negative emissions.

A global goal of zero emissions by 2050 (ZC2050) could be met by scenario SSP1-1.9 in the most recent IPCC report
1
. This scenario gives a c60% chance of exceeding 1.5 degrees and a small chance of exceeding 2 degrees. This year’s storms, floods and fires show that these risk levels are reckless. An earlier global zero emissions target date is required. A 2030 target date would reduce the risk of exceeding 1.5 degrees to no more than c15%.

UK emissions are significant. Despite having less than 1% of the world’s population, the UK is responsible for 5% of aggregate global emissions. If we add the emissions resulting from UK imports, the figure would be about 8%
2
.

So we cannot accept a 2050 target date – and nor should you.

What are the key requirements for a governance structure that can deliver cross-Government
climate action at the pace, scale and over the duration required to meet the carbon budgets and the
2050 net zero target?
The first and most critical requirement is a government that is fully committed to vigorous
action. Without that the most appropriate structures staffed by the world’s best leaders and
project managers will surely fail. In fact, without such commitment the government will be
unable to recruit or retain the best people
The structures of government should be based on: 

A clear line of ministerial responsibility for action.

A public body to be responsible for major programmes unsuited to the private sector.

Authoritative and independent scrutiny.

A much reduced role for industry lobbyists.

A legal duty for every government department (and private company) to prioritise
actions to address the climate emergency.

A precautionary principle that requires actions to be performed as soon as possible
rather than as late.

Honest metrics, ie metrics that include the UK’s responsibility for the emissions in its
supply chain and which minimise opportunities for ‘gaming’.

a) Are the Government
’
s existing net zero governance structures effective in this role, both in terms of coordination across Whitehall, and coordination with the devolved administrations and local and regional authorities? 

The most recent report by the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) shows they are not performing. Indeed, the UK is still expanding road and aviation infrastructure rather than decarbonising them and approving a new oil field and coal mine!
3

 

To date, competing priorities have resulted in climate actions being delayed, avoided or watered down. This is not acceptable when so much is at stake and when early action will be both more effective and significantly cheaper. 

There has been no meaningful co-ordination with local authorities even though a majority of principal authorities have declared climate emergencies and adopted net zero targets. This is reflected in a recent report by the NAO.
4 

b) What alternative governance structures could be established to coordinate and deliver cross- Government action on climate change more effectively? 

To implement the principles above the government should: 

Appoint a senior cabinet member to oversee the transition through a Department of Climate Mitigation. The department would be able to block any proposed new infrastructure (whether publicly or privately funded) that is not within the UK’s carbon budgets and make recommendations for changes to the Green Book
5
and the planning system.

Transform the remit of the National Infrastructure Commission. Give it the authority and funding to create low-carbon infrastructure including but not limited to the national grid, a national network of EV charging points, CO
2
sequestration facilities, hydrogen hubs and a delivery network and active travel facilities.

Strengthen the Climate Change Committee’s powers and independence.
c) What metrics should the Government use to measure their progress towards net zero?
The most critical metrics are greenhouse gas emissions and removals – we’ll call these principal metrics. There should be separate measures and targets for CO
2
and the other greenhouse gases and for imported
6
and territorial emissions. The processes of data collection and estimation need improvement, especially for international travel and imported emissions. This will require embedded carbon to be included in customs declaration and procedures.

There’s a danger that a blinkered pursuit of a single goal will cause spillover damage in other areas. Therefore measures of the biodiversity and abundance of the natural world should also be treated as principal metrics as should metrics for inequality of income and wealth. 

A wide variety of secondary metrics are needed to reveal progress in the various sectors. It’s important that many of these should relate directly to emissions. Thus, we have more need to know the miles driven in petrol and diesel cars than the number of new e-cars bought. 

For each principal climate metric and sector the CCC should set annual targets. (The biodiversity and abundance targets should be set by the Nature Conservation Committee
7
.) Annual targets for secondary metrics should be set by the relevant government departments, subject to CCC approval. 

The Office of National Statistics (ONS) should publish actual numbers including variation against budget each quarter. In each case the variations should be negative.
8 

However, it’s not enough to have new metrics; we must also downgrade the importance of two old ones: GDP and government borrowing. 

With regard to GDP government needs to accept that the high-carbon parts of the economy will decline whilst low-carbon sectors will expand. The overall economic impact is not clear but since dealing with climate change is more important than economic growth there may be a need for the overall economy to shrink. 

Government borrowing will be high early on in the transition to ensure the government is able to fund the changes. 

These changes will require an increase in the staff of the CCC and retraining of many Treasury staff. 

2. What governance structures would enable HM Treasury to give greater priority to the net zero target and the carbon budgets in its financial and economic decisions? 

The government must reform the Green Book to ensure that its procurement rules support its climate targets. Government requires businesses bidding for contracts greater than £5 million to central government to align to its climate targets.
9
This should be extended to all government contracts, including existing private finance mechanisms and framework agreements, as well as reflected in processes within governments. 

Governance of international aid and trade agreements must include climate as a priority. The UK should withdraw from or renegotiate all trade agreements that include Investor- State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) processes that could be used to block action on climate change. Currently trade agreements risk significantly increasing UK imported emissions.
10

 

UK overseas investments, such as to extend trade corridors, must consider its climate impacts. 

The obligation to maximise fossil fuel extraction should be abolished. 

a) How could HMT better ensure that spending decisions contribute to achieving net zero in the long term? 

The planning system and the government’s climate targets are not aligned and therefore not currently fit for purpose, as exemplified by the recent permissions to expand onshore oil and gas extraction
11
and airports.
12
The planning system should be reformed to make climate change a governing factor in both national and local planning decisions
13
by: 

Prioritising climate, natural and wellbeing targets over purely economic ones; as discussed above.

Ensuring that climate change is integrated into infrastructure and other long-term procurement investment decisions.

Requiring every investment to align with planning for net zero14.

Reforming the National Infrastructure Commission – see the answer to question 1b.

Aligning government procurement and its Green Book to its climate targets. 3. What signals and support does business need from the Government in order to deliver cross- economy decarbonisation in line with the carbon budgets and the net zero target?
The terms signals and support are too weak. The climate emergency demands something closer to a wartime mobilisation than to ‘government as usual’. The crisis is not, yet, severe enough to require full national mobilisation. The following may be sufficient:
· Tax all UK territorial carbon emissions and use border tax adjustment to tax imported emissions, starting at £100/tonneCO
2
e and rising to at least £400 by 2030.
· Greatly increase in investment in green infrastructure and the decarbonisation of the whole economy under a Green New Deal.
· Require all large and middling business to adopt Sustainable Cost Accounting
15
; that is, they should:

o report on their carbon emissions, including emissions from their UK and international supply chains. 

o prepare a detailed and costed plan to reduce emissions including setting clear targets and milestones to achieve net zero. The expected costs to meet their targets should be included as a provision in their annual accounts, written off against actual progress. 

o show the expected costs of decarbonising their businesses in the main parts of their accounts, the whole to be subject to audit on the usual basis. 

· Instigate a Just Transition
16
plan to retrain and redeploy workers from high carbon sectors, especially in the geographic areas most affected. This would show that the government is not supportive of a return to ‘flying-as-normal’ post-Covid and has plans that will not just transform businesses but will see employees as key stakeholders and enablers of change. 

Each sector will also need specific policies, for instance: 

Immediately stop all airport expansion and road building.

Ban first the sale and then the use on public roads of all fossil-fuelled vehicles by
2035; preferably sooner for cars and vans.

Require all new buildings to reach passivhaus
17
or equivalent standard for energy
efficiency.

Expand and improve the training of building workers.

Start and then rapidly expand an ambitious national retrofit programme to raise the
energy efficiency of all existing buildings.

Ban all advertising that encourages the purchase or use of high-carbon products.
3 (cont). What delivery function should Government provide itself and are relevant regulatory bodies mandated and resourced effectively to deliver on Government priorities?
The government (and here we include the devolved administrations) must plan, monitor and report to parliament (and to the devolved assemblies).
The delivery responsibilities will vary by sector. For instance:

With regard to the National Retrofit Programme the government will have to
mandate action and provide much of the money but we think the Programme should
be managed by local authorities.

To decarbonise industry at the speed needed will require both regulation and
funding, especially subsidies for new low-carbon technologies.

A sharp increase in funding for research in low-carbon technologies will be essential.
The transition will eliminate some jobs and introduce others. Overall we do not expect a loss of jobs – indeed we worry whether there will be enough workers to do those needed! But there will be huge needs for retraining and some people will have to relocate (as so many did during the Industrial Revolution). The government must take responsibility for retraining and minimising disruption to families and communities – arranging a Just Transition.
The government will need to legislate and reregulate at extraordinary speed so the safe working assumption is that neither government departments nor regulatory bodies are properly prepared or resourced.
a) How do policy and regulatory signals and support vary between Government Departments 1. (and how have they varied over time)?

2. How is this affecting business activity on climate change? 

The most urgent priority for government is clarity and consistency. Perhaps the government’s greatest problem is its track record of U-turns and rapid and unexpected policy changes. For example on the rate of the solar Feed-In Tariff, funding for Carbon Capture and Sequestration pilots and mandating Zero Carbon Homes. In each case businesses and consumers had made plans, and sometimes investments, in the expectation that the government would do what it had promised. 

For businesses this inconsistency creates a ‘policy risk’ - a risk that effort and money will be wasted because the government does not do what it said it would. The government’s handling of the Covid epidemic and the Grenfell aftermath has added to business concerns about policy risk. To address this HMG should: 

a)  Develop a cross-party consensus on the changes needed.
b)  Make plans that the CCC judges likely to meet the carbon budgets.
c)  Not change them arbitrarily.

Even so, the government will have to provide more of the money needed than might have been needed had it had a better track record. 

b) Should Ofgem play a greater role in delivering on net zero and, if so, what changes are required to deliver this? 

No view. 

4. The BEIS Committee will be working with the Environmental Audit Committee on this inquiry and inviting guests from other select committees. 

We are also interested in comments on the effectiveness of current parliamentary scrutiny arrangements for climate change and proposals to improve this. 

The actions required by the Climate Emergency present challenges unprecedented in peacetime. It would therefore be surprising if current arrangements were satisfactory and we do not think they are. In our view scrutiny should reflect the required governance arrangements. That is: 

There should be a Climate Emergency Select committee working with Departmental Committees.

All should be able to request work from the CCC.

Interim Policy: amendment to Monetary Policy

Synopsis

Policy Development Committee confirms that this motion has been properly proposed under clause 14viii of the Constitution.

Motion

Amend EC664 b). ‘The 1844 Bank Charter Act will be updated to prohibit banks from creating national currency in the form of electronic credit. To finance their lending, investment or proprietary trading activities, banks will have to borrow or raise the necessary national currency from savers and investors’

By

Deleting the sentence beginning , "To finance their lending” and replace with, “To finance their lending, retail private and community banks must raise the necessary national currency from savers and investors or, if this is insufficient, borrow (newly created money) from the National Monetary Authority. Investment banks will need to finance their investment and proprietary trading activities solely from savers and investors’

The amended clause will read:

‘The 1844 Bank Charter Act will be updated to prohibit banks from creating national currency in the form of electronic credit. To finance their lending, retail private and community banks must raise the necessary national currency from savers and investors or, if this is insufficient, borrow (newly created money) from the National Monetary Authority. Investment banks will need to finance their investment and proprietary trading activities solely from savers and investors.’

Amend EC664 d) ‘Any new money created by the National Monetary Authority will be credited to the account of the Government as additional revenue, to be spent into circulation in the economy in accordance with the budget approved by Parliament;

By adding the following to the existing clause:

‘… or lent to retail private and community banks provided it is solely used for lending for desirable purposes as defined by parliament. Such purposes may include sustainable and productive business lending, provided the level of lending is non-inflationary. Investment banks will not have access to NMA credit.’

The amended clause will read:

‘Any new money created by the NMA will either be credited to the account of the Government as additional revenue, to be spent into circulation in the economy in accordance with the budget approved by Parliament or lent to retail private and community banks provided it is solely used for lending for desirable purposes as defined by parliament. Such purposes may include sustainable and productive business lending, provided the level of lending is non-inflationary. Investment banks will not have access to NMA credit.’

Zane’s Law

Conference notes that current UK regulations with regard to toxic waste disposal and the danger to human life, to our environment, and to the planet as a whole, from both historic landfill sites and currently approved landfill sites operating the ‘dry tomb’ principle, are dangerously inadequate. Especially so, in the face of climate breakdown, with rising sea levels, increased rainfall, and widespread flooding.

In 2014, 7-year-old Zane Gbangbola died, and his father was paralysed with a diagnosis of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) poisoning, during catastrophic flooding in the UK. It is understood that flood water passing through a historic landfill site carried HCN into Zane’s home, detected there at high levels by the Fire and Rescue Services on the night of the tragedy. What happened that night is expected to be the subject of an Independent Panel Inquiry.

‘Zane’s Law’ seeks to address the crisis of contaminated land, aligning the UK with global best practice for the protection of communities from hazardous land, reflecting the current concerns of the climate crisis, and reinstating legislative provisions removed by the government from the 1990 Environment Protection Act. The protection of citizens should be a primary government responsibility, as enshrined in the 
Universal Right to a Healthy Environment
, endorsed by the UN General Assembly in July 2022.

Conference, therefore, fully supports the Truth About Zane Campaign’s call for ‘Zane’s Law’ which 
proposes
 that the following measures be adopted into legislation by Government, to prioritise the protection and safety of people and planet.

The Legislation if passed would include:

1.    Each relevant Local Authority must keep a full, regularly updated Register of Land that may be contaminated within their boundary.

2.    The Environment Agency must keep a full, public ‘National Register of Contaminated Land’ to be regularly updated by information from Local Authorities.

3.    All above mentioned Registers of Land must be accessible and available for inspection by the General Public.

4.    Relevant Local Authorities must fully inspect any land registered that may be contaminated and must fully remediate or enforce remediation of any land which poses harm to public safety, or which pollutes controlled waters\*

5.    Relevant Local Authorities must be responsible for inspecting 
previously closed landfill
 sites and fully remediating them, or enforcing their remediation when they pose a risk of significant harm to people or controlled waters.

6.    The Government must 
take full responsibility
 for providing the necessary funds for Local Authorities to meet these new requirements, following the ‘
polluter pays
’ principle: to recover costs as appropriate where those responsible for the pollution can be identified.

These measures are not all in place currently and would require significant investment and full funding from the Government to be implemented. Other statutory requirements (such as data protection provisions) would need be taken account of.

- Controlled waters are groundwater or surface water intended for human consumption

General Election Manifesto - Ratification (C04 aut 2024)

Conference is asked to ratify the
Green Party General Election Manifesto 2024, long version with cover

Amendments that were passed

1)     Property Taxes

The proposed change is to clarify that this is a central policy and relates to the taxation of wealth.

p. 21 of GEM2024 currently reads:

‘Our long-term policy aim is a Land Value Tax so that those with the most valuable and largest land holdings would contribute the most. In the next parliament, elected Greens will take steps towards this by pushing for… [this is followed by a series of bullet points].’

Conference approves the following changes:

Delete ‘long-term’

After ‘holdings’, insert ‘(a significant source of wealth)’

Delete ‘In the next parliament, elected Greens will take steps towards this by pushing for’

Insert ‘Preparatory steps towards this in the next parliament will include’

Such that it reads:

‘Our policy aim is a Land Value Tax so that those with the most valuable and largest land holdings (a significant source of wealth) would contribute the most. Preparatory steps towards this in the next parliament will include…[followed by the bullet points as they currently appear].’

2)     Business Taxes

The change deletes the example of hospitality from the policy to remove VAT as this requires more nuanced policy development in order not to negatively impact health. The biggest beneficiaries of this as currently stated would be purveyors of unhealthy food that contributes to our health crisis, including corporations such as McDonald’s. The example of ‘the arts’ remains unchanged.

p. 21 of GEM2024 currently reads:

‘We would also propose a range of changes to VAT, reducing it on hard-pressed areas such as hospitality and the arts and increasing it on financial services and private education.’

Conference approves the following changes:

After ‘such as’, delete ‘hospitality and’.

Such that it reads:

‘We would also propose a range of changes to VAT, reducing it on hard-pressed areas such as the arts and increasing it on financial services and private education.’

Consequential change:

On p. 45, increase the Business Taxes figure by £3bn per year and adjust the total accordingly.

3)     Carbon Tax

Correction to basis of figures being carbon dioxide or equivalent, not carbon.

p. 21 of GEM2024 currently reads:

‘£120 per tonne, rising to a maximum of £500 per tonne of carbon emitted within ten years’

Conference approves the following changes:

After ‘£120 per tonne’ add ‘of carbon dioxide equivalent’

After ‘£500 per tonne’ delete ‘of carbon’

Such that it reads:

‘£120 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), rising to a maximum of £500 per tonne emitted within ten years’

4)     Public Sector Debt

To shift the language around public finance.

p. 22 of GEM2024 currently reads:

Title: ‘Public Sector Debt’

Final paragraph: ‘Greens will not allow our country to be held back by fiscal rules that don’t serve us all – we’re prepared to tax wealth and carbon emissions and prepared to borrow to invest in a fairer future.’

Conference approves the following changes:

In the title, delete ‘Debt’

Insert ‘Investment’

In the final paragraph, after ‘all – ‘, delete ‘we’re prepared to tax wealth and carbon emissions and prepared to borrow to invest in a fairer future.’

Insert ‘Greens will invest in a fairer future and are prepared to tax wealth and carbon emissions.’

Such that it reads:

‘Public Sector Investment’

‘Greens will not allow our country to be held back by fiscal rules that don’t serve us all – Greens will invest in a fairer future and are prepared to tax wealth and carbon emissions.’

5)     Comment in table of numbers

Further shifting of language to avoid negative connotations in the public understanding of deficit and debt.

p. 45 of GEM2024 currently reads:

At the bottom of the table: ‘Deficit – funded by additional debt’

Delete: ‘Deficit – funded by additional debt’

Insert: ‘Additional public investment required’

Amendment passed: After the following words in Part 4) of the motion: 

‘‘Greens will not allow our country to be held back by fiscal rules that don’t serve us all – Greens will invest in a fairer future and are prepared to tax wealth and carbon emissions.’
Insert the words: ‘and utilise the fiscal space available to the currency issuing sovereign government.’

Such that it reads:
‘Greens will not allow our country to be held back by fiscal rules that don’t serve us all – Greens will invest in a fairer future and are prepared to tax wealth and carbon emissions, and utilise the fiscal space available to the currency issuing sovereign government.’

Freeports

The Green Party opposes the introduction of Freeports and Special Economic Zones across the United Kingdom. Introduction of these areas displaces economic activity from elsewhere and reduces tax revenue that is so desperately needed by our public services. The lack of transparency in decision making and reductions in environmental, planning and employment legislation are all reasons that should alarm every UK citizen.  

The Green Party notes that Freeports potentially threaten Trade Union rights to organise within workplaces to protect workers’ rights to proper pay and conditions. If Freeports are introduced in spite of opposition, all relevant Trade Unions must be fully consulted and allowed to organise their members within Freeport workplaces

Green Rail Strategy for the Midlands and the North

The Green Party recognises that transport pollution remains stubbornly high, and that there is a need to reduce transport demand to sustainable levels. In tandem, there is a simultaneous need to make the greenest modes of transport the easiest and cheapest modes of transport. This necessitates a transformative transition away from polluting modes such as cars and planes towards efficient, electrified public transport. This is consistent with the Party’s strategy to reduce: use of materials, batteries, chemicals and fuels; carbon emissions; air/particulate pollution; noise pollution; urban sprawl; land take from biofuel production; poor public health; and road deaths of adults, children and wildlife.  

Accordingly, the Green Party supports high speed rail in principle. The Party recognises that high speed rail lines free up capacity on other rail lines that serve regional and local rail services allowing for more frequent trains to run on these lines. High speed rail lines themselves reduce domestic flights and car journeys for long distance travel because they can better compete for shorter journey times. The uplift in passenger capacity also provides an opportunity to dramatically reduce rail fares. The Party’s support for high speed rail in practice is nonetheless contingent on its delivery aligning with Green values. 

Specifically, these values will necessitate:  

·            Proper timely data releases relating to the ongoing impacts of HS2, using up to date biodiversity metrics and not excluding any habitats;

  ·            Limiting adverse impacts on biodiversity and bioabundance, and, where adverse impacts are unavoidable, securing a 10% biodiversity net gain within the development site;  

·            Independent monitoring of impacts and remediation schemes; and  

·            Proper compensation for those affected by the scheme’s construction.  

The Green Party calls for a local transport revolution to be implemented upon the completion of HS2 and the resultant uplift in rail capacity. This capacity should be used by transferring intercity expresses from the existing railway network to HS2, and then utilising the newly freed-up space for new local services to, in and around towns and cities across England and Wales. Specifically, the Green Party calls for these new services to be directed to the following towns and cities:

(i)           Those which would benefit from new capacity by virtue of being located along a main line which would be relieved by HS2, such as Bedford, Doncaster, Grantham, Leicester, Loughborough, Luton, Milton Keynes, Peterborough, Stamford and Stevenage

(ii)          Those which would benefit from new capacity following the removal of network bottlenecks in Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester, such as Bolton, Bradford, Bristol, Cheltenham, Coventry, Huddersfield, Northampton, Oxford, Warrington, Worcester and communities in north and mid-Wales; and

(iii)        Those which would benefit directly from new connectivity, namely Birmingham, Derby, Leeds, Manchester, Nottingham and Sheffield.

To encourage the switchover from cars and planes to electrified trains, the Green Party supports the slashing of rail fares which should be possible, as it is in Germany, France and Spain, once the supply of thousands of new seats on improved rail services has been delivered.

In addition to the above, the Green Party supports utilising the uplift in rail capacity to switch freight from lorries and planes to trains to as full an extent as logistically possible.The Green Party recognises that the first phase of HS2 between London and Birmingham is well under construction, although its implementation has had significant ecological impacts. The austerity and mismanagement which have prolonged these impacts must end. The project must ensure that the ecological costs of HS2 are outweighed by wider environmental benefits—but half an HS2 brings too many costs and too few benefits. The full network could be used to reduce aviation and car dependency, but only if the Conservatives’ ill-timed cuts to Phases 2a and 2b of HS2 are now reversed. In order to maximise the benefits of high speed rail, the Green Party will therefore hold the UK Government and HS2 Ltd. to account to ensure: delivery and efficient use of Phases 2a and 2b to Manchester and Leeds (via Sheffield); greater public control of railways; maximum capacity release on the rail network; a subsequent slashing of rail fares to reduce car journeys; and a subsequent ban on domestic commercial aviation within England and Wales. In doing so, the Party will ensure the delivery of environmental benefits and improvements to regional inequality, providing critical support for an underground through station at Manchester Piccadilly, 11 platforms at London Euston, the Golborne Link (or a better replacement) which enables HS2 services to be easily used on parts of the existing West Coast Main Line to Lancashire, Cumbria and Scotland as well as the originally planned bicycle routes alongside parts of the HS2 route accordance with existing Green Party policy. Station design will be passenger-led and community-focused, with excellent cycling connections and level boarding to ensure accessibility for all. Positive environmental outcomes will be delivered by each of the stations achieving a BREEAM status of excellent or better.

The Green Party calls for the impact of HS2 to be improved further by funding and building Northern Powerhouse Rail which includes a high speed rail line from Liverpool to Leeds with through stations in Manchester and Bradford. This will use HS2 infrastructure in Manchester including potentially sharing the underground HS2 station at Manchester Piccadilly. The Green Party calls for HS2 services to be extended to Liverpool using Northern Powerhouse Rail infrastructure around Liverpool.

The Green Party calls for both HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail to be reclassified as England-only projects rather than England-and-Wales projects. This more accurately reflects the projects’ geographical location and will importantly ensure that Wales receives its fair share of funding under the Barnett Formula. Given that it is not possible to travel by rail between the north and south of Wales (without going on an hours-long route through England), this transformational uplift in rail investment is crucial to the nation’s efforts to connect communities; strengthen cultural ties; resist calls for road-building; reduce car dependency; and tackle the climate and ecological emergencies.

Recognition of Israeli ‘Apartheid’, Israel’s ‘Genocide’ and Supporting the BDS Movement in Communication

1.  Recognise Israeli Regime as an
    “
    Apartheid” and Amend Policies for a Sustainable Society in the International Section following IP634:
    The Green Party recognises and condemns Israel’s policies as apartheid, based on international treaty and customary law, including, most notably, but not limited to:

- International Convention on Apartheid (1973) and Rome Statute (1998)
  : Israel’s practices, including extrajudicial killings, severe movement restrictions, discriminatory laws, and economic exploitation, align with apartheid definitions.
- International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (1965)
  : Israel’s racial segregation and discrimination violate this treaty, which Israel ratified in 1979.
  We call for an end to all forms of apartheid and equal rights for all. The term “apartheid” accurately describes the institutionalised regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over another, as identified by international human rights bodies and legal experts.
  2.  Recognise Israel
  ’
  s Genocide and Use the term
  “
  Genocide”:
  The Green Party condemns genocide per the UN Genocide Convention (1948):
  Acts qualifying as genocide
  : Israeli military operations causing civilian deaths, severe mental and physical harm, life conditions threatening Palestinian survival, and policies disrupting Palestinian family life and heritage.
  As of 2024, the systematic violence and restrictions on Palestinians meet the criteria for genocide. This motion ensures our positions comply with international law and our commitment to justice and human rights.
  Affirm Green Party
  ’
  s Support for the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) Movement: 
  The Green Party should have included its explicit support for the BDS Palestine Movement in the 2024 manifesto. We affirm our commitment to explicitly supporting BDS in our internal and external communications going forward. Supporting the BDS movement is essential to holding Israel accountable, to supporting Palestinians’ rights to equality and self-determination, and to demonstrating that our support, as a nation, is not performative. Israel should not be able to profit from its apartheid regime or its unlawful occupation of Palestinian land. If the UK Government has learned anything from its failure to support BDS during South African Apartheid, it must be that the impact of applying political pressure is nothing without an economic response. Anti-apartheid promises are hollow if nothing is done to reform the institutions that fund apartheid regimes. The UK Government must not make the same mistakes again.

Solidarity with Women in Afghanistan

Conference notes that:

Since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Afghanistan, women have been systematically erased from society, being ordered against leaving their homes without a male relative, banned from secondary education, and banned from working in most sectors.

Women protesting for their rights have faced violence from security forces.

The UK government does not recognise the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan and has no formal diplomatic relations with the regime. Dialogue with Taliban officials occurs in Qatar through the UK Mission to Afghanistan, providing the UK with a unique opportunity to advocate for Afghan women.

In August 2024, women were ordered to cover their entire bodies in public, banned from looking directly at men they are not related to, and banned from speaking in public.

In protest, women in Afghanistan have been posting videos online singing and criticising the regime.

Conference:

Condemns the Taliban’s treatment of women and believes it to be nothing short of a humanitarian crisis.

Supports United Nations experts’ calls for the recognition of gender apartheid under international law as a crime against humanity.

Endorses Amnesty International’s demands of the UK government: to consult with women-led organisations in Afghanistan, support Afghan women’s rights activists, ensure that protecting women’s rights is non-negotiable with the Taliban, and provide safe passage for Afghan women and girls seeking asylum in the UK.

Calls on the six Green Party Parliamentarians to advocate for the 14 million women and girls in Afghanistan and urge the Government to follow Amnesty International’s demands.

Stop Gatwick and Luton Expansion

The Government’s decisions on whether to permit expansion of Gatwick and Luton Airports is imminent. For Gatwick, the examination for the Development Consent Order (DCO) closed on 27th August and recommendation to the Secretary of State for Transport is due by 27th November. Luton’s decision was due on 10th August and has now been delayed until 10th October.

On 19th August the Secretary of State for Transport, Louise Haigh, approved expansion of London City Airport without consulting parliament, prioritising economic growth over climate and other impacts.

Conference calls on our 6 Green parliamentarians and the Green Party Executive to call on the Secretary of State for Transport to review the UK aviation strategy (Jet Zero) to ensure that it aligns with Paris climate commitments, to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C, before recommending decisions on these matters to be debated by Parliament.
