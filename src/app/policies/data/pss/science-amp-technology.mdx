# Science &amp; Technology

[bs-toc depth="5"]

Objectives

ST100
The basic aim of our Science and Technology policy is to encourage and promote research, development and application of science and technology which will:

Increase knowledge and understanding.

Help to understand and address the major environmental threats such as climate change, pollution and biodiversity losses.

Contribute to a better quality of life for all the inhabitants of the world.

Science

Principles

ST200
We believe that people are naturally curious about the world, and enjoy extending their knowledge by scientific study. This research is a worthwhile activity in its own right. Scientific study must not be restricted to that which is deemed likely to result in narrow short term economic benefit.

ST201
Science and technology have made enormous contributions to our civilisation and wellbeing. However, irresponsible use of science and technology have undoubtedly resulted in problems for society, We recognise that when used responsibly science and technology have great potential to be part of the solution to many problems, including environmental ones, However, we recognize that that there are very unlikely to be any technological ‘quick fixes’ and that science needs to be part of a coordinated response alongside political and economic solutions.

Policies

ST210
Scientific research requires proper funding. We value basic research and will ensure it is properly funded. We believe that it is important to have a wide body of research that is not funded or controlled by large corporations.

ST211
We will increase public spending on R&D to at least 1% of GDP.

ST212
We will ensure funding streams are long-term and ensure sufficient revenue streams are available for the maintenance and operation of all capital investments. We will separate subscriptions for international projects from budgets for research grants and pay those subscriptions directly.

ST213
We will follow the Haldane principle that the Government may guide overall strategic direction, but research councils decide which projects are to be funded

Ethics

ST220
Research councils will be provided with a set of ethical criteria which are required to be met in order that research be funded with public money. These criteria will be developed through broad consultation and will include consideration of human and animal welfare, the protection of the environment and the effects on local and global society.

ST221
All publically funded research, including clinical trials, must publish its results, even if the results obtained were inconclusive or negative.

ST222
The results of all research performed at universities, but funded privately, should be subject to the Freedom of Information Act.

ST223
We support the Budapest Open Access Initiative and the Berlin Declaration on Open Access, and will strongly encourage results from publicly funded research to be published in Open Access journals where appropriate. Subsidies will be given towards any extra publishing costs.

Military

ST230
Military ("defence") research into science and technology has traditionally formed a substantial proportion of projects funded by the Government. The Green Party would reduce this to a low level sufficient to sustain the country's defensive conventional forces (see
Peace, Security and Defence: PSD400s
). Research resources no longer required for the military would be converted to civilian.

Ecology

ST240
Fundamental and applied research into the environment and the ecology of the biosphere and threatened habitats will attract a high level of funding. Research infrastructure will be developed to facilitate the long term multi-disciplinary research necessary for increasing our understanding of the requirements of a sustainable society.

ST241
International collaboration in research will be increased and free movement of ideas, knowledge and researchers between countries will be maintained and facilitated. Research in the Antarctic will be restricted to its environment and ecology (see
International: IP512
).

Education and Careers

ST250
Science education should aim to integrate science teaching with everyday life while still providing the building blocks for understanding basic science.

ST251
Non standard career structures will be encouraged, including movement between disciplines and entry and re-entry into research from other activities. Professional bodies must ensure they are fully representative of their members’ gender and ethnic background. If a profession or sector does not reflect the gender and ethnic make-up of the country the professional body must put in place a programme to ensure equal participation and a correction of any imbalance.

Scientific Advisors

ST260
We will ensure that scientific advisors work in an environment of academic freedom and are able to always make recommendations free of political interference.

ST270
We will ensure libel laws cannot be used to stifle scientific debate or academic freedom.

Technology

Background and Principles

ST300
We will support the development of technology that promises to benefit society and the planet, However we believe that technology must be regulated as outcomes may be malign. We do not believe that technological fixes alone will deal with the serious problems facing the planet.

ST301
There is a risk that further rapid technological change will bring about new and catastrophic threats to human survival and flourishing, and to the natural world. In line with our moral obligations to future generations, the Green Party supports the creation of a law formalising the Precautionary Principle to be applied to technologies that pose a plausible risk of ecocide, catastrophe or human extinction. The Precautionary Principle applies especially to those risks where we are uncertain or ignorant of their magnitude or likelihood.

ST302
Government funding will be allocated through research councils to projects investigating threats of ecocide, catastrophe and human extinction. The findings of such research will be used to inform public policy.

Policies

Product Standards Commission

ST330
All industrial products should be well designed and well made to ensure longevity and optimum use of resources (see
Natural Resources and Waste Management: NR420s
). Goods should be durable and designed with ease of repair or recycling as high priorities.

ST331
Technology should not be designed with inbuilt obsolescence. Software and hardware producers must work together to ensure that new developments do not render relatively new equipment obsolete.

ST332
Standards Commissions will be set up to assess product designs (see
Natural Resources and Waste Management: NR425
). Design requirements should reflect the need for environmental protection and the need for durable goods to be repairable or recyclable.

ST333
The Standards Commissions would also promote the development and use of labelling and marking systems for materials used in products and packaging to facilitate recycling.

ST334
Taxation policy (see
Economy: EC700s
) will ensure that the prices of products will incorporate the real costs of the use of non-renewable resources, transport, any pollution caused and eventual safe disposal (e.g. recycling).

Patents on Genes and Living Organisms

ST360
The Green Party is opposed to the patenting of genes and living organisms for the following reasons:

Patents may make access to genetic resources more difficult and in some cases block that access altogether. Research and development can be hindered, and in many cases the resulting costs are disproportionately high. These problems are of particular relevance to health services and medical research, but their consequences can also be seen in agriculture and plant breeding.

Living organisms are not the same as human technical inventions and it is unethical to afford patent rights on them to an individual or company. (See
Economy: EC1015
and
International: IP353
).

Genetic Engineering

ST361
The Green Party accepts that certain uses of genetic engineering may be benign and may lead to enhanced quality of life, but believes that the release of GMOs (genetically modified organisms) into the environment potentially poses substantial risks to biodiversity, human health and animal welfare and that there is currently insufficient research to quantify risks. In addition, genetic engineering of animals can cause significant suffering.

ST362
Control of research and the use of genetic engineering by a few multinational companies threatens the autonomy of farmers and health services and makes profit an underlying motive for the use of GMOs.

ST363
We believe that:

The precautionary principle must be applied to research using genetic engineering.

Research should be genuinely in the interests of humanity.

Animal welfare and biodiversity must be protected in research (See also
Animal Rights: AR408
,
Animal Rights: AR412
).

ST364
The Green Party supports a moratorium on the release of GMOs into the environment and on importation of food and feed containing GMOs, pending comprehensive assessment of the safety of GMOs with regards to the environment, biodiversity and human and animal health. We support a legally-binding protocol making industry liable for cross-contamination and any adverse effects of GMOs. (See also
Climate Emergency: CC254
,
Europe: EU489
, Food and Agriculture: FA206f).

Aid and Development

ST370
Technological aid to developing countries should be appropriate and should avoid exploitation and dependency. The validity of local knowledge and techniques should be acknowledged, and self-reliance encouraged (see
International: IP222
). We will enable benign technologies to be freely transferred to developing countries.

The regulation of artificial intelligence (AI)

ST380
We recognise the potential of AI to be of great benefit, including to achieve a sustainable future for our society, but also acknowledge both immediate and evidenced harms to our freedoms, social cohesion, livelihoods and democratic processes, and concerns about existential threats. As a result, we insist that there should be comprehensive, legally-enforceable regulation of AI to address ecological, social and economic harm, and guide developments to better serve people and the planet.

ST381
We will establish a robust regulatory system to provide oversight and coordination for sectoral regulation of data and AI. A coordinating body will recruit and develop the interdisciplinary expertise required to respond promptly to new AI developments. This body’s overall aim will be to use regulation to effectively drive AI development and usage in line with the precautionary principle: ensuring systems are safe, transparent, accountable and both human and nature-centric.

We will take a risk-based approach to establish proportionate disclosure, participation, impact assessment and audit/compliance requirements for AI systems and applications. General purpose AI and generative AI pose systemic risks so will be subject to strict regulation. When risks are well managed, AI has the potential to make a positive contribution to our society, economy and environment.

ST382
We shall place deliberative and democratic processes, and the voices of those most affected by particular technology development and deployment, at the heart of data governance and AI regulation. Workers and other stakeholders must be actively involved in decisions about adoption of data and AI tools in the workplace and public life, and adoption decisions must be made at the lowest possible level in consultation with those affected.

ST383
We will introduce energy performance and water consumption labelling for AI systems to allow informed choice of their use and as a mechanism to drive improvements in their ecological impact.

ST384
Our economic and tax policies provide the basis for active intervention to address AI market concentration and monopolies, including through an internationally coordinated approach.

ST385
To ensure individuals and communities have prompt access to redress, we will create an AI Ombudsman to champion the rights of individuals and groups who submit complaints, or have complaints submitted on their behalf, relating to material or other harm from AI system output or decision-making.

ST386
Research funding, regulatory sandboxes, and public procurement processes will be used to guide AI innovation towards provision of public good, building on our strong national foundations of technical excellence, social science research and innovative business. Where AI is used to augment professional practice, we will ensure humans still make all key decisions, and where automated decision making significantly affects lives, this is done with care and humanity, and with speedy access to mechanisms for correction and redress.

ST387
We will prohibit certain uses of AI by law, including lethal autonomous weapons systems (See
Peace, Security and Defence: PSD541
); AI systems that use deception (faking, impersonation etc) to manipulate behaviour or negatively impact on informed decision-making and/or democratic processes; routine biometric identification in public places; and emotion-recognition systems in workplaces or educational settings.

ST388
There can be no effective AI regulation without data governance. Therefore, we will ensure that robust data protection rules, and the inalienable moral rights of creators to have their contribution to creative output recognised, are respected. Developers of AI systems must respect all applicable copyright laws. In line with policy
Science & Technology: ST223
we recognise the value of making publicly-funded digital content freely accessible, including for training machine-learning models, alongside developing transparency standards so that sources of data may be verified and accurately referenced.

ST389
We will implement support for those whose livelihoods are disrupted by AI deployment, and will ensure workers’ rights and interests are respected when AI leads to significant changes in working conditions (See
Workers' Rights and Employment: WR104
and
Workers' Rights and Employment: WR206
). We see Universal Basic Income (see
Economy: EC402
) as one important tool to proactively and positively respond to potential AI impacts on working lives; we see public education in good use of AI as another tool to enable individuals the freedom to live a worthwhile life, devoting time in whatever proportions they choose to the following “seven C’s”: - Curiosity, Conservation, Challenge, Creativity, Community, Charity, Care.

ST390
Our AI regulatory system will foster international links and encourage global collaboration towards establishing a world-wide body to oversee and police AI development, including establishing norms for AI to produce output that is in harmony with established human rights principles and sustainable development goals.
