Policies for a Sustainable Society (PSS)

Policies for a Sustainable Society (PSS) are arranged in chapters of varying length covering different topic areas. They represent the long term goals of the party and are available through the menu of links on the right of this page.

Each subject chapter contains the policies agreed and amended at successive Green Party conferences. These detailed policies are explained and illustrated from time to time in election manifestos, news releases, topical comment and reports. Both national and local policy objectives are derived from PSS.
