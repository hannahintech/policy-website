# Policy

Uniquely for any Westminster Party, you can directly affect
Green Party
Policy by becoming a member.

This website is a record of our policies built up over the last 40 years of the Party's existence.

Our members shape our policy

The Green Party aims to create a just, equitable and sustainable society. We focus our efforts primarily, though not exclusively, through the electoral system.

The Green Party is a democratic organisation in which our members decide our policy, opening up politics to those outside the Westminster Establishment. Our members come from all walks of life; most of them are not professional politicians, but each of them can have a voice in how our policies are written, updated and amended.

Thus, uniquely for any Westminster Party, you can directly affect this Policy Process
by becoming a member
.

This policy process produces an organic and evolving document (known as Policies for a Sustainable Society or PSS) that reflects current priorities and principles.  Our PSS changes twice a year as a result of our democratic process - the Spring and Autumn conferences of the Green Party are the supreme policy making body.

For each General and European election we produce a manifesto - this sets out our immediate priorities and policy goals that Green representatives would pursue for the term of that Parliament. Each manifesto is based on our PSS and is prepared through an agreed consultative process within the Party.

What's on this website

This site is a record of our policies built up over the last 50 years of the Party's existence.

Our Principles

This section is in two parts; a short statement of our 
Core Values
, and a longer explanation, called the 
Philosophical Basis
, of the underlying thinking and motives behind our policies.

Policy Statements

Our Policy Statements are contained within two main sections, Policies for a Sustainable Society (PSS) and the Record of Policy Statements (RoPS).

Policies for a Sustainable Society (PSS) are arranged in chapters of varying length covering different topic areas. They represent the long term goals of the party and are available through the menu of links on the right of this page.

Each subject chapter contains the policies agreed and amended at successive Green Party conferences. These detailed policies are explained and illustrated from time to time in election manifestos, news releases, topical comment and reports. Both national and local policy objectives are derived from PSS.

The 
Record of Policy Statements
 consists of short term positions and responses to particular current circumstances. These statements do not override the vision contained in the full set of Policies for a Sustainable Society
