Declining Quality of Rivers and Coastal Waters

This statement is a response from the Wildlife & Habitats PWG to the declining quality of rivers notably in England due to the failure of the private water companies to properly monitor pollution levels and build the infrastructure needed to protect water quality. All policies are drawn from the PfSS

1. This Conference deplores the declining quality of rivers, estuaries and inshore waters of England and holds this Government’s ideologically driven policy of privatisations and ‘small state’ to be responsible.

2. We recall that the privatisation of water was sold to the British Public as the most efficient means of attracting the needed investment to clean up our rivers and replace our antiquated sewerage system. It is apparent to us that this promise has been broken.

3. We question the Government’s claim that water quality is ‘better now than at any time since the Industrial Revolution,’ and support the scientific view that the state of our rivers is ‘unacceptably poor’. We also take note of the Environment Agency’s findings in 2020 that ‘0% of rivers, lakes and streams are classed as in good health in England.’

4. We note with great concern that the ownership of the water companies has now largely passed to private equity companies whose interest is in maximising profit for dividend and bonus payments and not environmental protection.

5. We also note that the Government has cut the Environment Agency budget by nearly two thirds since 2010 leading to the loss of over 1700 members of staff, severely limiting the Agency’s ability to monitor and hold the Water Companies to account.

6. We therefore demand that:

the private water companies are taken back into public ownership [NR413]

the Government develops and implements a comprehensive national conservation and regeneration strategy for nature to include all bodies of freshwater, estuaries and inshore coastal waters to reverse the loss of biodiversity. [WH200]

the Polluter pays principle shall apply to all discharges of effluent water and runoff and any subsequent damage caused. [PL431]

waste disposal using ‘dilute and disperse’ will no longer be generally acceptable. [PL428]

all sewage is fully treated to realise its potential for biogas generation or as fertiliser so that waste water can be safely returned to rivers. [NR413]

the use of inorganic fertilisers and pesticides on farms is reduced through regulation and through a progressive switch to eco-agricultural practices to safeguard long term water and food resources. [FA206]

polluted runoff from urban areas and roads is treated before discharge to rivers or coastal waters.

the discharge of stormwater to rivers and coastal waters is only allowed in extreme circumstances to protect lives and property. All such discharges must be reported to the Environment Agency together with a statement on how such overflows can be prevented in the future. Any other storm discharge will carry an automatic fine to the discharging body in line with the ‘polluter pays’ principle. [PL431]

Planning Authorities and the relevant government departments are required to assess all development proposals for their impact on the sewage and drainage systems. Where proposals risk overloading the system the developer will be required to show how they will increase capacity for safe discharge of waste and drainage water, otherwise the proposal will be refused. [LP 203, 306, 406]

the Government restores the grant to the Environment Agency to at least its value in 2010 to enable the Agency to carry out its monitoring and enforcement responsibilities.

Dolphin hunts

In 2019 UK Government finalised a free trade agreement (FTA) with Faroe Islands which allows for £100 million of exports of wild caught and farmed fish to Britain per annum (20% of the Faroe Islands global trade). This FTA should be suspended until all whale & dolphin hunts on Faroe Islands end

The Free Trade Agreement with the Faroe Islands gives the UK Government significant leverage when it comes to ending the mass slaughter of pilot whales and dolphins on the Faroe Islands which causes huge anger and revulsion around the world. If the UK is to be considered a world leader in the protection of marine mammals it must use this leverage now.

DEFRA and Crustacean Mortality Synopsis

Conference instructs GPRC and Green Party Parliamentarians to urgently campaign for the adoption by the government of a policy requiring an improved toxins sampling regime in Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) which, in addition to the current fixed range of substances tested for, is also specifically referenced to the historic usage of the site for which the licence application is being sought. And that in the case of marine licences the Marine Management Organisation must ensure that this improved historically-based toxins sampling regime is wholly thorough, independent of the people standing to make a profit, and adequate in order to avoid pollution leading to death of sea life and loss of livelihood for fishing communities during the construction of other Freeports and similar projects and protect the marine and coastal environment and human inhabitants and visitors there.’

Green Party solidarity with Gary Lineker 

We believe that the point he was making around the deliberately cruel approach to Conservative asylum policy was entirely valid. The Conservatives’ deliberate stoking of this issue as part of their incessant culture war also serves as a distraction from the urgent humanitarian crisis on our doorstep. The issue of desperate refugees should not be used as a political football.

Policy on artificial intelligence

POLICY STATEMENT on ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (also known as Machine Learning; referred to as AI throughout for ease of reading and to align with current EU, UN and UK Government publications)

The Green Party of England and Wales acknowledges that there are both threats and potential benefits for a sustainable future for humanity possible with the increasing prevalence of AI. We recognise significant concerns about current harms created by inadequately regulated adoption of AI technologies, noting in particular the impacts of AI bias on minority communities, the environmental costs of AI usage, and the impacts on workers. We note concerns about potential existential threats from AI.  

We will introduce a precautionary regulatory system to address the harms and risk of AI and secure equitable access to the benefits these technologies can bring. In creating this regulatory framework we shall base much upon the EU AI Act (ref 1), UNESCO recommendations (ref 2), the Global Green Congress Emergency Resolution on AI Regulation (ref 3) and aim to ensure UK legislation and practice aligns with these.  We shall also foster international co-operation towards the establishment of a world-wide body that could oversee and police AI development globally.  We will place deliberative and democratic decision making, and the voice of those most affected by AI technology development and adoption at the heart of any decision making and governance processes.

Through regulation we will oversee that AI development is based on ethical principles for development and deployment so that systems using AI are safe, robust, transparent, accountable, and human-centric. Development will be regulated into producing systems that are socially and environmentally responsible, that include consultation and participatory decision making with those affected by AI systems, also safeguards against inappropriate, measures to address and rectify existing bias, discrimination and equality issues, measures that protect the privacy and liberty of individuals and communities, ways to rectify mistakes made and ways to allow use to be switched off or paused.  

We neither aim nor wish to stifle the innovation and development of AI as an important sector of our economy nor to reduce the UK’s current status as one of the most advanced nations in this field. To this end our current research frameworks will be enhanced along with other developmental ideas including “sandboxes” for safe yet innovative trialling of AI systems.

In addition to preserving freedoms, personal safety and maintaining physical health for every individual to a standard similar to that enjoyed in the UK today, AI development and usage will be regulated to encourage and facilitate for all individuals the freedom to live a worthwhile life, devoting time in whatever proportions they choose to the following “seven C’s”: - Curiosity, Conservation, Challenge, Creativity, Community, Charity, Care.

Initial regulation will make mandatory that AI generated content is always clearly identified as such, i.e we will regulate to prevent any instance where someone may act on or be influenced by the product of AI system without being aware of this, or under the impression that the content is generated by another human. We see this as an essential safeguard of our democratic processes. Many of the pernicious uses currently available or foreseen including social media influencing, news media or voter manipulation, deep-faking, virtual friendship apps, open-source AI based platforms and others will be controlled by this.

We will enable uses of AI in the interests of national security and defence whilst avoiding an arms-race developing between ourselves and other nations, also ensuring that “human-in-the-loop” control is always required in accordance with our policies PSD541 and PSD421. We will regulate the use of biometric identification, including prohibiting its use in public spaces.

We will require that the burgeoning uses of AI within the commercial sphere put social and environmental priorities ahead of financial returns to shareholders in line with our economic policies. AI may well create a new pattern of distribution of wealth and earning power with the potential for a few to accrue a great deal while others lose out, so we shall ensure our tax policies are able to address this fairly.

We assert that every individual has a right to the control of their own identity in terms of appearance, sound and style of creative output. AI platforms that can generate written text, music, images or realistic films will automatically be subject to strong regulation which will make clear the way in which an individual can claim unfair use of their own creative output and curtail its continued use; the individual’s moral right to be recognised as creator of any work will be inalienable (i.e cannot be signed away). More generally, copyright control may be extended so that AI providers compensate authors, musicians, artists and data producers such as published scientific data sets rather than assuming the internet is free. Data produced from publicly funded work might be freely consumed nationally and shared internationally in line with policy ST223.

The many positive uses of AI that already exist in the field of healthcare, fostered by enabling many independent research initiatives from central funding, will continue to be grown and the framework for doing so shared into other spheres including education, local government, the judiciary, transport and utility management and infrastructure. We will regulate to ensure that wherever automated decision making significantly affects people's lives, this is done with care and humanity, and with speedy access to mechanisms for correction and redress.

We acknowledge the great potential for AI usage to augment, not replace, many professionals such as doctors, teachers and lawyers to the benefit of those receiving their services, whilst still retaining the need for humans to make all key decisions. Additionally, we aim to make available training in AI literacy and use for all so that we can each make good use of AI, for example to create our own healthy lifestyle plans or individualised learning plans with AI assistance.  In recognition of the many concerns over jobs and livelihoods owing to AI development we will implement packages of job retraining support for those displaced and we will introduce measures to ensure workers’ rights and interests are respected when AI leads to significant changes in working conditions, with particular reference to policies WR104 and WR206. We also see the growth of AI as making more likely and more immediate the need for Universal Basic Income, which we will introduce, policy EC402. Far from being just a safety net, UBI is a start towards enabling people to break free from the current model where so many labour essentially to benefit already wealthy shareholders and propagate our destructive levels of consumption. Universal Basic Income we see as a starting place for allowing us all to develop harmonious lives in which we feel enriched and valued beyond our current market-orientated measures; this truly is the potential of AI to transform our society and individual experience for the better, which we strive to bring into being.
